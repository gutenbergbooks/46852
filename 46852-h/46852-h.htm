<p class="p2">"Well, I was wan. The two Maddens was two.
Eddie Carey was three. Jim Powers was four. And&mdash;and&mdash;But
there was five of us, an' I know it. Wait.
I'll count fresh.</p>

<p>"I was wan. The two Maddens was two. Eddie Carey
was three. Jim Powers was four&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shtop it, Casey! I say, Shtop it! I'll be as crazy as
you next. Altogether, I say, altogether how many of
you was on the picnic? <i>All</i>-together!"</p>

<p>"Five, I repeat. On me honor as a bricklayer! Five,
I will have it. But I cannot, for the life of me, recollect
the fifth. I'll count <span class="locked">again&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I was wan. The two Maddens was two&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Augusta opened the door to announce tearfully:</p>

<p>"Mister Jimmie, the boarders are saying that they
can't stand it!"</p>

<p>"To arms!" cried Jimmie Wardwell, leaping up from
the table and typewriter where he had been laboriously
pounding out Casey's count of the picnic, "to arms to
repel boarders!"</p>

<p>And he caught the wholly unready and dignified
Augusta full in his arms and kissed her fairly.</p>

<p>Now Augusta is somewhat incredible. I suppose I
can hardly make you understand her&mdash;as much of her,
I mean, as I could ever understand. But, having a
whole book before me in which to deal with her, I am
going to try to explain to you the things about her
which may be explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
There was, for instance, Augusta's look of seraphic
innocence. Women looked at her the first time and she
looked back at them with her friendly, ready-to-wear&mdash;"Good
morning, I hope you are as happy as I am,"
look.</p>

<p>Then they drew away from her with a defensive
pursing of backs, saying:</p>

<p>"She <i>can't</i> be so good as that! Or so innocent!"</p>

<p>But then, as they continued to study her, they saw
that she was just the gold that she showed. Then they
took her suddenly to their hearts and wanted to
mother her.</p>

<p>Here it must be explained that Augusta had never
till this moment been kissed by a man. She knew that
there was no harm in Jimmie Wardwell's kiss. To know
innocence and harmlessness, when one meets them,
is as great a part of wisdom as to know their opposites
when met. Augusta had this large division of wisdom.
Yet she was unaccountably hurt by Jimmie's act.</p>

<p>She was angry, but not with the anger that would
prompt her to box his ears; as would have been adequate
in a smaller matter. She would not let it go as a boy-and-girl
tilt.</p>

<p>Jimmie Wardwell, looking into the dry, pained
depths of the girl's gray-blue eyes, saw that she was not
going to be angry in any ordinary way. He had hurt her.
And he was going to be punished. He stood, suddenly
quiet and sober, awaiting his verdict.</p>

<p>"You will have to leave the house, Mr. Wardwell,"
she said at last, very quietly. "You must make your
own reason. I do not wish to be obliged to tell mother."</p>

<p>She had spoken with a grave, settled finality which
left Jimmie Wardwell silent and without defense.</p>

<p>The girl dropped the matter where she had finished
it. Nor did she return to the other matter about which
she had come to the room. She crossed to the typewriter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and stood looking down reading the story that showed
half written there.</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to begin on your own
work," she said, ignoring everything that had passed.</p>

<p>Wardwell knew that he had been ordered out of his
boarding house as definitely as if his trunk had been
deposited on Eighteenth Street. But he was willing to
forget that for the instant and to answer on the new
ground that she had chosen.</p>

<p>"I did do something on the book," he said. "But
what's the use! I can't put the time on it. I'd never
finish it. I have to live. And that"&mdash;&mdash;he pointed
angrily at the paper on the machine&mdash;&mdash;"that's the
only kind of stuff that anybody'll pay me for! I couldn't
sell that if it wasn't ancient and bearded!"</p>

<p>"You couldn't sell that," the grave critic answered
judiciously, "if it wasn't good of it's kind. But you
don't love it. So you always hate to have to do it, and
you must get away from it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Wardwell, "I must." But it was plain
that he was not thinking of her wise counsel about himself
and his work. He was thinking of this child&mdash;She
was no more in time, just a year out of Julia Richman
High School. Yet it was a woman's personality that
looked out of her child's dancing eyes.</p>

<p>He did think of returning to the question of his
leaving. But he remembered that there was no question.
It was not a matter of appeasing her anger, of explaining.
She knew. She understood. And she had spoken her
decision.</p>

<p>"I wonder," the girl said, crossing to look down into
the street. "Mother is very long in coming. And she
never delays. Could anything happen to her between
here and Sixteenth Street. But, of course, what <i>could</i>
happen! She goes and comes every morning. And everybody
knows her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
"I don't know," said Jimmie darkly, peering doubtfully
down into the street. "This great city is full of
designing men. I've often wondered how you let her go
about the streets in broad day unchaperoned. A lovely
woman, an altogether delectable woman!" he proceeded,
warming up to his nonsense. "Why, she's not safe a
minute!"</p>

<p>"In fact," he announced cheerfully, "I've often
thought of running away with her myself."</p>

<p>Augusta's laugh broke through the gathering cloud
of anxiety on her face, and her eyes danced as she
thought of her mother, Rose Wilding, Rose the strong,
the capable, the wise, the mother of all the street, being
carried off&mdash;Her white hair, her broad, stately person,
her two hundred pounds of active woman!</p>

<p>"You're right, of course; I know you are. It's silly
to think of anything happening to her. But sometimes,
you know, before things happen a feeling of dread
comes over me. And I just <i>know</i> that something is
wrong. I don't know where it comes from, or how. Did
you ever feel yourself waiting for a loud shock to come
before you hear it?"</p>

<p>Wardwell looked sharply at the girl for an instant.
He had heard some strange things from women in the
boarding house. They certainly believed that Augusta
had some insight or foresight, or something. She had
told them things about themselves. But when he spoke
he was blandly didactic.</p>

<p>"That, you know," he explained, "is just the first
quiver of the shock, felt by the ganglia, the nerve
knots; before the rude noise gets to the brain."</p>

<p>"<i>There was a man in our town</i>," Augusta chanted,
skipping to the door, "<i>And he was wondrous wise</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Wardwell listened to the receding hum of her voice
as it died down in the well of the stairs. Then he turned
and with a vicious yank tore the offending story of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Casey's picnic from the machine and ground the paper
into the floor with his heel.</p>

<p>An hour later he was sitting on the floor with half a
novel of loose sheets of paper scattered all about him.
He had found the table too small for the work, had
transferred his operations to the bed&mdash;he was cutting
madly at page after page of the type-written stuff&mdash;but,
finding that he was jabbing the pencil through the
paper, he had swept the whole business to the floor
and gone at it with vengeance.</p>

<p>He had spent eight months on the book, and it was
still a formless wad of words. There was an idea in it,
a live, working idea. But "The Feet of the Plodders,"
as he was calling the book, would neither plod nor jig.
They strutted along, he complained, stiff as wooden
horses, fatuous as roosters.</p>

<p>"You talk like a hatful of wood," he said contemptuously
to Gerald Straight, his hero, who, on
the paper, was giving out some pet ideas of Wardwell's
own on the dignity of labor. Down came the
pencil and the whole paragraph was condemned as,
"Rot!"</p>

<p>He did not notice Augusta coming back into the
room. He looked up as he grunted his disapproval of
what he had thought very fine while writing it.</p>

<p>The girl stood in the doorway, swaying and clutching
desperately at the door frame for support. She must
have run madly up the stairs, for it was plain that she
was breathless from physical exertion, as well as speechless
from some strange, uncanny fright.</p>

<p>"She's gone!" she gasped, as Wardwell jumped from
the floor and hurried to her. "I can almost see it! It
almost seems that I did see it," she went on, fighting
with herself to tell a plain story.</p>

<p>"The apple woman at the corner saw her fall. Her
head struck on the curb. The apple woman ran to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
But she got to her feet and walked away without looking
back.</p>

<p>"Right past her own doorway she went, without
looking up&mdash;the apple woman saw her&mdash;and straight
over toward Broadway.</p>

<p>"I ran all the way, asking, begging people to say
they'd seen her. But not one would say it!"</p>

<p>"But," said Wardwell, "it doesn't prove anything.
She was a little dazed. She didn't want to come in to
frighten you. She just walked around a little and went,
maybe, to a doctor. That's what she'd do, can't you
see?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could, Jimmie. But it isn't what she'd do at
all. She'd just walk quietly into the house, and I'd
never know that anything had happened.</p>

<p>"I'm going out again! I can't stay, she may be
wandering farther and farther from me every minute!"</p>

<p>There was a fierce, mothering eagerness in the girl's
voice, as though she already saw the tragedy of the
months to come, and had already taken up the burden
of being mother to her mother.</p>

<p>Wardwell laid a gentle hand on the girl's shoulder,
saying:</p>

<p>"I think you could better let me go. I can go farther
than you."</p>

<p>"She went toward Broadway," the girl said slowly.
"But it's no use trying to save me that way. I must
find her <i>myself</i>. I <i>know</i> that."</p>

<p>Jimmie had already pushed past her through the
door and started for the stairs. He saw that she was in
such a state that unless she saw someone doing something
she would herself start out again.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said simply. "But I cannot
promise to stay in."</p>

<p>"I think you must. You know we're both foolish.
We don't either of us really believe that anything's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
happened to her. But you must stay in. She's sure to
come in any minute."</p>

<p>Arguing her into a kind of silent promise that she
would not go out and would not worry, Wardwell left
the house and started east through Eighteenth Street.</p>

<p>In the open, quiet street, away from the urge of
Augusta's excitement, Wardwell felt entirely foolish.
He expected to see the strong-willed, self-reliant
woman who was Augusta's mother coming along the
street at any moment, and he wondered what he should
say to her.</p>

<p>Nothing ever did happen, anyway. Rose Wilding had
just walked into a drug store or a doctor's, maybe, and
had had to wait. That was it, of course.</p>

<p>He walked toward Broadway, taking, without any
conscious notion of following a trace, the direction which
the old apple woman had given.</p>

<p>Coming out of the quiet cross street he stepped
thoughtlessly into the rush of traffic that sweeps through
Union Square. An automobile brushed carelessly by
within inches of him. A great lumbering truck came
charging down upon him. A motorcycle screamed at
his ear. He leaped back to the curb, muttering at the
grinning fiend in goggles who shot past.</p>

<p>Wardwell stood on the curb looking out over the
shifting lines and tides of trucks, handcarts, automobiles,
horses and people. He was looking for one person
out of the hundreds and hundreds that moved within
range of his eye. As well, he thought, look for a particular
stone in the paving.</p>

<p>A few men have stepped into the wilderness and
never been seen again. But how many, many men, and
women, have stepped off a curb into a stream like that
and never been seen again.</p>

<p>There's Flynn, the cop, across the street. He knows
me by sight. He could say he saw me step off the curb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
And that's all he could say. I could lose myself from
anybody that ever saw me. The string that holds us
where we are is so thin that&mdash;Why it's a wonder that
anybody stays where he is! It's so easy to walk out,
completely out!</p>

<p>And then some of Augusta's excited worry came
upon him. Rose Wilding <i>might</i> have been stunned by
the fall. She <i>might</i> have walked, dazed, right past her
own door, right off this curb and into that sea of moving
life!</p>

<p>"Is it kiddin' me you are?" snorted officer Flynn.
"Lookin' for your boarding mistress! More like, she's
lookin' for you."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," said Jimmie quietly. "I'm right in
earnest. Her daughter has it that she fell and struck
her head on the curb, and lost&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure. There'd have to be a daughter in it."</p>

<p>"Oh, go to Blazes!" snapped Jimmie, turning on his
heel.</p>

<p>"I might have known better," he growled as he
walked away. "They never do anything unless you
show them a corpse. And then they'd like to club you
for giving them trouble."</p>

<p>He turned south, looking to the only other resource
he knew. He was a New Yorker with all of a New
Yorker's entire dependence on the two forces that
govern his town&mdash;the police and the newspapers.</p>

<p>At Astor Place he ran across Jim Ray, a dark little
crank of a man, a man who looked as old as the first
thing that ever happened, and seemed to have been
present at every happening since the first. He was
coming from a stormy, snapping interview with an
irate, bullying financier, and he was on his way to get
the personal story of an interesting adventuress who
had gotten herself into jail.</p>

<p>But he listened to Wardwell. In fact, he always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
listened to everything, until he was sure it was not worth
listening to.</p>

<p>He had known Wardwell during the latter's sporadic
incursions into newspaper work, and had shown a
grudging, contrary sort of liking for him.</p>

<p>"Which do you want to go on," Ray questioned noncommittally,
"the facts, or the daughter's imagination?"</p>

<p>"Both," said Wardwell stubbornly.</p>

<p>"All right," Ray admitted. "But, if you don't want
to be guyed, stick to the facts. Go on down to the
office, Grayson will be just about coming in. Tell him
I sent you. He'll give the word to the boys as they're
going out on their assignments. If anything has happened
to the woman, they'll get the thread somewhere."</p>

<p>Wardwell was more or less at home in Newspaper
Row, and he thoroughly believed that no accident
happening in the city could slip through the net of
active intelligence centered there. When he had gotten
assurance that the word would be passed to all the
reporters going out for their rounds, that every newspaper
in the city would be informed, that every police
blotter and hospital record would be scanned, he started
back to the house with the sure feeling that he had done
all that was possible.</p>

<p>Augusta listened, dry-eyed, almost listless, it seemed.
She did not say anything. It was plain that she had
expected nothing from his search. And Wardwell was
chilled by the obvious fact, that he had really accomplished
nothing.</p>

<p>Augusta sat a little while, not seeming to notice that
Wardwell had stopped speaking. Her soft blue eyes
took on a deep, dark blue in which there was no visible
expression. Her features were strained and sharp, as
though she reached somewhere to another medium of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
knowledge, outside the common senses. After a little
she said vaguely:</p>

<p>"She is not hurt. Not that way. She cannot be found
that way. She has lost her thought. I've never yet
called to her without getting an answer."</p>

<p>"Eh, what's that?" questioned Jimmie sharply.</p>

<p>The girl seemed to be awakened by his voice. She
shivered and suddenly jumped up from her chair.</p>

<p>"What was I saying&mdash;? I don't remember."</p>

<p>"You were saying something about calling her and
always getting an answer. I don't think you ought to
worry so," he soothed. "We haven't the least reason to
think that anything's happened her. It couldn't be
anything bad, or we'd know of it before now."</p>

<p>Augusta moved quietly out of the common parlor
where she had been sitting by the window, and stood
at the glass in the hall, putting on her coat. She had
been in street dress and had evidently only been waiting
for Wardwell to come in before she should go out.</p>

<p>"What have you eaten today?" Wardwell asked,
trying to interpose the commonplace, for he was
frightened at the strange suppressed quiet of the
girl.</p>

<p>"I had my breakfast," she said, without turning.</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's 'long in the afternoon now. You
mustn't think of going out without something. Come
into the kitchen and we'll see if Ann hasn't some tea,
or something."</p>

<p>"Will you make her eat, Misther Jimmie!" Ann
appealed. "She's beyond me. Her worritin' about Rose
Wildin' that's as safe in the sthreet as a blessed child!
Sure, she stepped into a neighbor's somewhere an' had
a bite an' a chat. An' now, I'll bet ye what ye dare,
she's calyin' over about Jimmie Hearn's, askin' the
price o' things she don't want."</p>

<p>The big gaunt Irishwoman who ruled the kitchen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the boarding house set them down at her own white
table, while she drew tea and scolded:</p>

<p>"You're worse nor she is, Misther Jimmie, humorin'
her."</p>

<p>But, with all her stout talk, it was plain to Wardwell
that Ann had been listening to Augusta. She kept up a
rattle of cheery scolding. She even hinted that the
whole affair, for all they knew, might be some of
Jimmie's own doing. She "wouldn't put it past him!"
But, under it all, Wardwell saw that she was nervous.</p>

<p>Augusta, with a kind of forced obedience, was
munching at a piece of bread when that straining,
listening look came to her face again. Wardwell caught
himself turning unconsciously to follow her gaze. He
pulled himself back sharply, confused and half angry.
But Augusta had not noticed.</p>

<p>With that same expectant, baffled look in her eyes,
she rose quickly from the table and hurried out through
the dark hall to the door, as though she followed a call
which she could not quite hear or understand.</p>

<p>When Wardwell caught up with her on the street,
except that she tacitly allowed him to fall into step
beside her, she gave no sign of being aware of him.</p>

<p>He had a curious feeling, as they hurried through the
street, of walking with a somnambulist. Yet the girl
seemed entirely able to care for herself. He saw that she
knew just where she was going, that she was aware of
everything moving about her. Only, there was that
strange, in-seeing, strained detachment about her, as
though she were trying to look or listen into another
world of sight and sound.</p>

<p>Here began those incredible nightmare days, and
nights, when it seemed that they were forever in the
street, hurrying, the girl leading, Wardwell a wholly
useless body-guard following, from house to house of
all the people who had known Rose Wilding. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
came the fearful, timid questionings, at hospitals, at
emergency wards, at police stations. And all the while
Wardwell kept every newspaper office in town in a
constant bad temper with his persistent prodding, by
telephone.</p>

<p>Augusta did not go to the newspaper offices, either
because she believed that Wardwell's acquaintance
would get more attention than she could, or because she
believed, as she had said in the beginning, that she
herself must find her mother.</p>

<p>Then there were the worse times, when Wardwell,
leaving Augusta peremptorily in the hands of Ann,
went by himself on the last, gruesome, hopeless round.
He did not tell Augusta that he was going to the
morgue. He said nothing when he came back, gray of
face and deathly quiet in spite of his every effort to
hold up cheer. But Augusta knew where he had been,
and what he had seen&mdash;and what he had not found.</p>

<p>As the days went on Jim Ray put his wits to the
matter. It began to be baffling, and as a thing became
puzzling just so Jim Ray's interest in it grew in proportion.</p>

<p>But in the end, he gave his verdict:</p>

<p>"She is not in this city, Wardwell. She must have
left it by her own will, and in an ordinary way. Nothing
else could have happened, I'd stake thirty years of
work on it."</p>

<p>"But that's just what she wouldn't do! What she
couldn't do! Why, she couldn't in her right mind walk
off and leave her daughter!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Ray imperturbably, "that's just what
fills newspapers&mdash;people doing what they couldn't and
wouldn't."</p>

<p>So Wardwell saw that Jim Ray was ready to give
up. And he knew that when Ray gave up a matter it
meant that the resources of newspaper tracing had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
exhausted. To himself, he was willing to admit that
Ray must be right. Rose Wilding, it seemed, must have
gone out of the city in a quiet, commonplace way. But,
walking the streets at Augusta's side, watching that
tense, listening look upon her face, seeing her evidently
straining for a sight or a voice that she could not quite
get, he was again ready to believe with Augusta that
Rose Wilding was near, that Augusta would find her.</p>

<p>There were days now when Augusta walked, as it
seemed, aimlessly. There were no more definite places
to be visited. She walked, Wardwell, with a dull pain
of helplessness, dogged and uncomplaining at her side,
through lower Fifth Avenue and University Place at
the noon time when the thousands of women and girls
spilled out from loft buildings and swarmed the sidewalks.
Evening found her watching the cross streets
from Broome to Fourteenth Street, searching excitedly
the myriad faces of the crowds that move eastward to
that world wonder of human hives, the great East Side.</p>

<p>One half of working Manhattan rides jammed, complaining,
but submissive, to its wide flung homes. The
other half walks, hurrying, stooping away from the
setting sun, into that unexplored, uncounted medley
of crowded tenements which lies beyond Second Avenue.
It was the faces of these hurrying, jostling thousands
that Augusta scanned desperately in the falling darkness
of the cold November evenings. Until it was long past
dark and the streams of people had begun to fail, they
walked and watched.</p>

<p>But Wardwell, watching the girl, the weary, sharply
cut look in her face, the pinched, thinning lines of her
slender body as she walked home beside him, decided
that this must stop. There could be but one end of it
for the high strung, over-sensitized mind of the girl.</p>

<p>There was no one to whom he could appeal as having
authority. So far as he had learned in the year which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
he had lived in Mrs. Wilding's house, she had no relatives.
But some one must soon take a way of stopping
Augusta from this hopeless, unending search.</p>

<p>"We both know it's doing no good, Augusta. And
you're breaking yourself down," he reasoned with her
one morning, when three weeks of looking had given
not the slightest clue to the whereabouts of her mother.
"She will come back somehow, I am sure. And she
mustn't come to find you a wreck. She'll be needing
your care. Don't you think I'm right, little girl?"</p>

<p>"Of course, you're right, Mr. Jimmie. You're always
right, now. And you've been so good to me. But I can't
stop. I can't stop! She's getting farther and farther
from me all the time, I must follow until I find her."</p>

<p>"But, child dear, you've done all that's within
human power. Now we can only wait and hope."
Jimmie was now the sobered gentleman, the tried and
patient servitor always at her side. Neither of them
knew how close to each other in sympathy and understanding
they had come in these weeks. They had, in
truth, been living in a world almost all by themselves
with their search. The girl was ready to listen, to believe,
to trust; but she could not promise obedience.
"I'll stay in today, if I can," she promised. "But, if I
hear her calling&mdash;"</p>

<p>With this he had to be content. And leaving her with
Ann he went to his room, hoping to get some work done.
His money was about gone. He must get some of the
hated skits ready for the Sunday paper from which he
drew a hand-to-mouth living.</p>

<p>In the middle of the forenoon he heard Ann's step
pounding heavily up the stairs of the quiet house.</p>

<p>"She's away out again, Misther Jimmie!" the big
woman panted. "I but shtepped out the alley to the
corner for an onion. An' I'm just back this blessed
minute. An' she's away!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Wardwell started for the door, but came back.
"There's no use going out now," he said. "I wouldn't
know where to look. Probably she has started off on
some new thought. But about noon I'll know where to
look for her. Don't worry, Ann; she's not in the least
danger." But it was a confidence he was far from feeling,
whatever his common sense might tell him.</p>

<p>Long before noon he was walking Fifth Avenue expecting
to see Augusta upon her quest among the
working women. But Augusta did not come. He went
home, not knowing what else to do, and sat stupid and
useless through the entire afternoon, waiting until it
should be time to go to look for her in the places they
had been haunting in the evenings of the last week or
so.</p>

<p>Just as the dusk was gathering he heard her key in
the door and ran down the stairs. She staggered into
his arms in the hall and began to cry fearfully. They
were the first tears that he had seen her cry in these
weeks, and he did not know whether it was good or bad.</p>

<p>"Oh Jimmie, Jimmie," she cried, with the first
direct appeal that she had made to him, "they wouldn't
let me have her! They wouldn't let her come with me!
I wanted to take her by the hand and bring her home.
And they wouldn't&mdash;She wanted to come!&mdash;They
wouldn't let me! Oh, Jimmie, they said she was a crazy
woman! My darling good mamma! She isn't crazy,
she just forgot.</p>

<p>"She said she was Rosie Dale&mdash;that was her name
before she was married&mdash;and that she was eighteen.
They had it in the book! And the man laughed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, dear. No, no, of course not," Wardwell
repeated soothingly as he carried her up to her mother's
room. When Ann had brought her something to drink
he sat down beside the lounge on which Augusta lay
and began to question quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
"Tell Ann and me," he prompted, "just where you
went first."</p>

<p>"To Bellevue. It came to my mind so strong. I just
had to go there. And I begged and begged with the
man who had the book, and then another man came,
and at last they let me see the book myself. And there
it was, Rosie Dale. You see she'd just forgotten. And I
asked the man, and he laughed. He said she was sixty
if she was a day! And she thought she was eighteen!
They brought her there from a hat factory. She used to
make hats when she first came to New York, a young
girl. I know it all now."</p>

<p>"And then?" questioned Wardwell quietly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmie, that was more than a week ago. They
took her there for 'observation.' Nobody knew anything
about her. And they sent her to Ward's Island.</p>

<p>"I went there over the cold, black water. Oh! it was
so cold and so black. But I didn't care, I was going
to get my darling mother.</p>

<p>"But they wouldn't let me go to her. They said it
wasn't the day. And one man was so cruel. He said
people ought to take better care of their folks. And, oh,
it wasn't my fault! Was it, Jimmie?"</p>

<p>"No, no, child, of course not."</p>

<p>"And then they did let me into the place. And I
waited and waited. And then I saw a door open, and I
looked in.</p>

<p>"Oh Jimmie, a great big room! And all the most
terrible people, looking so queer, and talking to themselves!
And, Jimmie, I said: That's <i>Hell</i> in there!</p>

<p>"And then, Oh! Over in a far corner, my poor darling
mamma, crouching, her back turned to the rest!</p>

<p>"Oh Jimmie, Jimmie! She didn't know me at all!
But she isn't crazy! You <i>know</i> she isn't! She's just forgotten.</p>

<p>"They took me away. They said I couldn't have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
her. They said I was only a little girl. Where was my
father? Didn't I have any brothers?</p>

<p>"And so they said&mdash;It was the head doctor now&mdash;He
said I couldn't have her, I wasn't of age, I couldn't
make a home for her.</p>

<p>"Then they&mdash;He said if I was married and had a
husband and a home I could have her. That was the
only way.</p>

<p>"Can that be so, Jimmie? Can that be so? Is that the
only way I can take her out of that place and have her?
Have I got to be married to have her with me? Have I
got to be married?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," said Jimmie, rising sharply and striding
across the room. "Why no, certainly, of&mdash;of&mdash;course
not&mdash;<i>of course not!</i>"</p>

<p>Then he turned to meet the brilliant, half hysterical,
pleading eyes of the girl fixed full upon him.</p>

<p>"Of course not. Of course&mdash;" he murmured, sitting
down again.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<p>Augusta's question was still ringing in Wardwell's
ears the next morning, as they stood near the bow of
the "Thomas J. Brennan" shivering in the driving
spray of the East River. He had gone out late last
night to look up a lawyer friend. He had learned that
what had been told Augusta yesterday was practically
correct. Short of having a good deal of money, there
was no way in which she could have her mother's
"commitment" set aside except by having a husband
and the surety of a home.</p>

<p>He had not told Augusta what he had learned, and
he knew that she was bringing him over here today in
the hope that he, or they combined, could induce the
hospital people to let her mother go home with her.
He knew that it was impossible, that they could do
nothing. But he had come because Augusta would
have come anyway, and he could not see her facing it
alone.</p>

<p>At the Island dock "Johnnie the Horse" met them,
and prancing up to Augusta motioned her to get into
the little wagon to which he had himself hitched.
Wardwell had heard of this harmless lunatic, had heard
the reporters laughing over his antics. But now when he
looked at him gambolling about, a great horse's tail
bobbing from his coat to carry out the crazy delusion
that he was a horse, he suddenly hated him. And he
cringed inwardly, thinking of Augusta having to come
and go through this. Why did they not keep such things
out of sight? He pushed roughly past the big gangling
lunatic and hurried Augusta along. But the fellow
pranced grotesquely along beside them, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
"You needn't mind me. I'm only Johnnie the Horse.
See me! I'm a horse! Look at me!"</p>

<p>Some one called to him and he turned back. But
Wardwell, feeling the tremor in Augusta's arm, swore
that she must not be allowed to go through this. He
did not know what he would do. There seemed to be
nothing that he could do.</p>

<p>They brought the patient out to where Wardwell and
Augusta sat. They had not been able to find clothes to
fit the large woman. The sight of her, untidy, forlorn,
the great hopeless wreck of her shapely, competent
self, brought a fresh shudder to Wardwell. He dared not
look at Augusta.</p>

<p>"You know me this morning, don't you, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, daughter, of course, of course." The big
Woman gently disengaged herself from Augusta's
clinging embrace and turned to where she had caught a
glimpse of Wardwell.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Jimmie, is it you? I thought of you when
they didn't come to find me. But I couldn't think of the
place. I got lost, it seems. My memory's not as good as
it was. And every day I was looking for a sight of my
little daughter Augusta coming to look for me. But I
wouldn't like her to see me here."</p>

<p>"Why, mamma darling," the girl broke in, "I'm
your Augusta! I'm your daughter. You called me
daughter yesterday. Don't you know me today?"</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter, hush; yes, to be sure."</p>

<p>Rose Wilding drew quietly away, leaving Augusta
dazed and heart sick. A fear more terrible than all&mdash;that
her mother did not know her at all, would never
know her&mdash;fell black upon her. True, her mother had
called her "daughter." But she remembered that Rose
Wilding had always had a habit of calling every girl
daughter. Every girl in the neighborhood had been
daughter with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
The big woman took Wardwell by the hand and led
him aside into a corner of the room.</p>

<p>"They're all like that here," she explained in a
cautious whisper. "Every one of them thinks she's somebody
else. I suppose the poor thing heard me speak of
my daughter, and it wandered into her head that she
was the one. And you might as well humor them. It
does them no harm. You never can tell what they'll
think of next. God help all that's afflicted!"</p>

<p>"But, that <i>is</i> your Augusta," said Wardwell.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Jimmie, you know you're always at you
nonsense!" Rose Wilding answered, smiling slowly at
him.</p>

<p>Now, curiously enough, it was that smile that brought
the perspiration to Wardwell's forehead. It was the
sane, deep, slowbreaking smile of Rose Wilding herself,
the smile that had won the heart and the confidence of
every child in every poor family of the parish. They
knew her all, the big woman, the big woman of the
smiling eyes, the mother heart, the never empty hand.
There was Rose Wilding herself, in that smile. And yet,
and yet&mdash;Wardwell reached at his tightening collar&mdash;there
was a something else, a something deeper, farther
away, elusive. And there was poor little stricken
Augusta, standing alone in the middle of the room.
He could see the sharp pink tips of her nails cutting
into the palms of her hands as she fought back the
bursting tears.</p>

<p>The blood rushed back into his heart and he felt
himself gasping as a man does when he takes the leap
in a desperate, cold dive. He did not know whether he
was a good man or not. He did not know whether he
was kind or cruel. But he knew that he had the answer
to Augusta's question of the night before.</p>

<p>He loved Augusta with a love which had deepened in
these weeks from a boy's harum-scarum affection into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the deep, tender, protecting love of a man. He loved
her, and would have given his life to save her the anguish
of having to leave her mother in this place. Yet,
he knew that it was unfair, wrong, unnatural. For her
mother's sake, Augusta would sacrifice herself and
marry any man. Wardwell knew it. Being Augusta,
there was no choice for her. It was cruel, an outrage on
her brave girlhood. But&mdash;So help him God!&mdash;he'd try
to see that she never suffered from it.</p>

<p>Thus Wardwell of the funny sheet.</p>

<p>He nodded quietly to Augusta to leave the room. She
went, strangely obedient to the look in his eyes. Then
he turned to Rose Wilding.</p>

<p>"Now, Mrs. Wilding," he said easily, "Augusta and I
are going to be married right away so that you can come
home and live with us."</p>

<p>Rose Wilding sat down easily, smiling broadly. She
seemed at ease once Augusta had left the room. "It
wouldn't do for you to be in this place long, Mr. Jimmie,"
she said, "if it acts that way on you."</p>

<p>She was so like herself in her answer, so sane, so
unruffled and ready, that Wardwell forgot the place
where they were, and why they were there, and began
to argue earnestly.</p>

<p>"Sounds funny, doesn't it? But then, it needn't. I
don't have to play the fool always. And if Augusta
cared enough for me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rose Wilding sat up with a sharp movement. Wardwell
could see the jealous, protecting mother-light in
her eyes, as she questioned sternly:</p>

<p>"Just what has been going on?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Jimmie honestly. "I have not
spoken a word to Augusta."</p>

<p>"Then it is just one other bit of your nonsense," she
said with an air that dropped the matter altogether.</p>

<p>And Wardwell let it stand so. For a moment he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
thought that he ought to try to make her understand.
But he suddenly felt the hopelessness of it. It would
not do any good. If she could understand, she would
never give her consent. And it might do her great harm
to let her be bothered and excited at this time. He and
Augusta would have to face the problem out for themselves.
A sudden wave of overpowering tenderness
came breaking over him, so that he never knew what
he said at leaving Rose Wilding.</p>

<p>He found Augusta out in a long, black corridor,
looking from a window down across the dreary face
of the water. She was so pathetically little, so tender, so
sensitive, so delicately fashioned for pain! With a queer
mingling of emotions, he found himself praying that she
might be spared; and at the same time almost cursing
himself because he was not a better man, more worthy
of her.</p>

<p>On the boat they were practically alone. And as they
stood out near the open prow, watching the cold drift
of the spray as it broke over the bow, they saw the busy
slits of streets sliding by, saw men and women how they
hurried about their own business, saw that no one had
time for thought of anything but that which concerned
himself in the way of living.</p>

<p>And I think it came to both these two, at the same
moment, how really alone they were out of all the world.
Their doings or their thoughts were of no account to
anyone. And in the weeks a common thought, an
anxiety shared, had drawn them together, had almost
made them forget that there was a world around
them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Augusta shivered and cowered against
Wardwell's arm.</p>

<p>"I can't," she moaned brokenly. "I can never stand
it! I shall go mad so they'll have to put me in there
too! And I know that if they'd only let me have Mamma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
she'd get all better and know me. If she was only at
home, she'd remember everything!"</p>

<p>Wardwell put his arm gently around her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to say it this way, dear," he said
softly. "But I think you know what I feel. I probably
wouldn't be much good, but I'd <i>serve</i>."</p>

<p>Augusta turned to look gravely up at him. It was a
new and strange Wardwell this, serious and humble.
He was so downright and simple, so clear in his boyish
honesty; she had not the slightest question. He meant
just what he said. He wanted her.</p>

<p>She reached up quietly and, taking his big blond face
in her little hands, kissed him deliberately on the lips.</p>

<p>Wardwell was astonished, frightened almost, by the
steady, instant decision of the girl's way. He had expected
to plead, to reason, to argue her into giving way
to him&mdash;while all the time he would be doubting
whether it was right. But she had taken decision out of
her own wise heart. And Jimmy Wardwell had never
again a thought but that it was the right decision.</p>

<p>They stood a little while clinging to each other, entirely
untroubled by any part of the world that might
be looking on or interesting itself.</p>

<p>Then Wardwell began to count the practical things.</p>

<p>"We'll have to see your priest, I suppose that's the
first thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, Fr. Davis. But he will know that I am right,"
she answered easily. "Maybe he will have to go to the
Cardinal's. But he will know that it's for Mamma. He
knows her so well, and how good she's always been to
everybody. He would do anything for her, I know he
will."</p>

<p>At the ferry house Wardwell announced that they
would ride across town in a taxicab.</p>

<p>"I'm on my way to be married," he proclaimed to
the general world. "I've got to start right."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
The strain of the weeks seemed to have lifted from
him. And although he knew that there were difficulties
ahead, he was in the mood to consider them all met and
vanquished. He was, in fact, Wardwell himself again.
Augusta saw the mood, knew that his feeling was
largely intended to make a hard place easy for her, and
she was willing to fall in with it, to a certain extent.</p>

<p>"You musn't spend all of your two dollars, Jimmie.
You know you'll have a lot of expenses."</p>

<p>"Who said two dollars? I've got more than two
dollars. I've got investments, mining stocks, real wealth.
I've got friends&mdash;I can borrow, potential wealth. I've
got a headful of jokes, and jokes without heads, or
tails; all wealth. And, if all these will not suffice, I've
got&mdash;<i>a dress suit!</i>" he wound up in a hoarse dramatic
whisper, looking warily around to see that his admission
was not caught by any who might have avaricious
designs toward the suit.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you'll need the dress suit."</p>

<p>"Not at all," he contended furiously. "We'll be
married early in the morning, when I couldn't possibly
wear the thing. I wouldn't feel respectable."</p>

<p>"I insist on the dress suit," Augusta said firmly.
"So, come,"&mdash;she was leading him towards the cross-town
car&mdash;, "I'll pay the fares, so you can save the
whole two dollars for some mighty extravagance."</p>

<p>"I suppose you're beginning the tyranny. But I
haven't got the will to resist. This is married life, I
suppose," he grumbled as he followed her to the car.</p>

<p>"I wonder who teaches them to begin right from the
beginning? Anyhow, it's going to be a success," he
groaned as he sat down beside her. "I can feel it right
from the start. Already I'm subdued, tamed, tractable!"</p>

<p>"You are a kind, dear gentleman," said Augusta with
a sudden gentle look up at him. And Wardwell went
strangely silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
At home, they found opposition where they had
least looked for it. Ann set herself vigorously against
the whole plan. She denounced Wardwell as a scheming
villain taking advantage of Augusta's youth and
ignorance.</p>

<p>"Not one foot further," she asserted stoutly, "will the
scheme go. I'll stop it myself. I'll not stand by and see
you profit from the poor lamb's trouble." She stood in
her kitchen, where her will was the law of the land,
and defied Wardwell foot and horse. "I always misdoubted
your right sense, with your skylarking. But
now I know you were only playing the fool to cover
your villainy. Any man that would think of such a
thing!"</p>

<p>"But he didn't think of it, Ann," said Augusta
quickly, "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think we'd better wait to know what the priest
says, Ann," Wardwell cut in quickly. "Surely you
won't go against what he says is right."</p>

<p>To this Ann had no answer, except to mutter that
no priest in his right mind would have anything to do
with such a thing.</p>

<p>In the sombre old parish house in Sixteenth Street
an austere and quiet man listened with sympathy to
Augusta, and studied Wardwell. He knew Rose Wilding.
He knew that there was no other way in which she
could be brought home to the love and care which she
would need. But the responsibility of asking a dispensation
for the immediate marriage of these two
children, as they seemed to him, was one that he did
not care to undertake.</p>

<p>In the end, in answer to Augusta's pleading, he said
slowly:</p>

<p>"I do not know. I feel that I am not wise enough to
advise. But I will send you to the Chancellor himself.
He can give you an instant answer, which I could not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
"Serves me right," said Wardwell, when they were
in the street again. "If I could have told him that I had
a regular job, he'd have listened to me. The best I
could say was that I was trying to write. And he was
too polite to tell me that all the people in the United
States that have ever been in high school, and plenty
that haven't, are trying that&mdash;or have tried it."</p>

<p>"You <i>can</i> write, Jimmie," said Augusta sincerely.
And then she smiled. "But you look so cherubically
young!"</p>

<p>"I'm twenty-four!" he exploded.</p>

<p>"And look nineteen, and, sometimes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Act fourteen, eh? That's right, let's fight. That'll
soon bring the wrinkles to my alabaster brow. And
then you'll be satisfied."</p>

<p>"We wont fight ever, Jimmie," said Augusta gently
as she took his arm and fell into step with him.</p>

<p>The Chancellor received them promptly when he
had read the note of introduction and explanation
which they had brought from the priest. He was an
extremely busy man whose work it was, day after day,
year after year, to give quick decisions which he knew
must affect the lives and happiness of individual men
and women. But in most of these decisions he had no
discretion. He had but to have the facts, and state the
inflexible law that governed him.</p>

<p>This, however, was a matter in which no law tied his
hands. Neither was there any law to direct his action.
He had only his own human judgment to tell him
whether what these two young people wished to do was
wise and right, or whether a sacrifice was not being
made by one or both of them which was not justifiable.
They were free, of course; but he was convinced from
Augusta's manner that if the Church would not sanction
the marriage, then Augusta would not be married.</p>

<p>He listened until Augusta had told her full story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
He asked Wardwell a question or two. He sat awhile in
thought. Then he arose quickly and walked into another
room.</p>

<p>Wardwell's trained reporter's ears noted that the
Chancellor was telephoning. When they had repeated
to him the word Eminence twice or three times, his
mind recorded mechanically that the Chancellor was
talking to the Cardinal. But he was not thinking of it.
He was watching the look in Augusta's eyes. For a little
time back, while they had been talking, he had noticed
that she was troubled and perplexed. He felt that the
difficulties and doubts that were being put in their
way were worrying her, perhaps making her less sure
than she had been that they were doing right. And he
felt himself wishing that they could have gone straight
to the license clerk, like other couples. But he knew
something of how Augusta felt about the matter, and
he would not think of asking her to do anything that
would hurt her.</p>

<p>Now she was sitting leaning forward in that listening,
straining attitude, with that same deep, unconscious
yearning in her eyes which he had seen in the weeks of
torturing search. As well as if she had told him, he
knew that she had forgotten him and the place where
she was, to listen to the call of her mother.</p>

<p>When they heard the priest's step coming back into
the room, Wardwell saw the look in her eyes turn
suddenly to one of quick, happy assurance. She looked
up at the Chancellor as he came toward them, and
Wardwell could see that there was not the slightest
doubt or fear in her mind but that everything was
right for them.</p>

<p>"I have spoken with the Cardinal," the Chancellor
said quickly. "He wishes to see you both. He is the
young lady's pastor, the Parish Priest of New York.
It is just a step around to the Avenue. You will go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
there, please," he said as they got to their feet. To
Wardwell, as he took his hand at parting, he added:</p>

<p>"Because you are strange to us, young man, you
may be thinking that unusual difficulties are being put
in your way. But, you are intelligent, you know that
we are thinking of just one thing, the life happiness of
this young girl and of you."</p>

<p>"I know that," said Wardwell simply, shaking hands.</p>

<p>In a little room, as simple and unadorned as the
quiet grace of his own bearing, the Parish Priest of New
York received them and began to question Augusta.</p>

<p>Wardwell, listening, found himself forgetting somewhat
of the business in hand and absorbed suddenly in
his own particular business. He was a born writer and
novelist, in spite of his own jibes. And, just as the true
artist finds himself forever reaching for a brush, he
could never be in the presence of character without
trying to grasp at the one vital element which was the
spring of it.</p>

<p>He had seen and studied power in many men, preachers,
demagogues, statesmen, men of the business that is
called big. He knew that there was but one individual
in the world who could speak an authorative word to
more people than could this quiet-spoken, ageing man
before him. But a sense of power was not the dominating
impression which he got. There was something
fuller, more complete than mere power. There was a
sense of ripeness, of comprehension, of&mdash;of <i>understanding</i>.
He had the word at last. The Parish Priest of
New York&mdash;that was it. If this man were the pastor of
a little country place he would know and understand
every man, woman and child in it. Here, he was as
near to every soul of the millions that looked to him as
he was to the little girl who now sat before him telling
him why she wanted to be married.</p>

<p>"I think you have realized already, child, that marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
must not be undertaken for any but the one motive.
That you should wish to marry in order to care
for your mother is very good in you, but it is not
enough either for you or for the man whom you would
marry."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it is right for me to marry Jimmie, I know
it is right, Your Eminence."</p>

<p>"Could you tell me how you know?" the Cardinal
probed gently.</p>

<p>Augusta did not answer. She looked straight towards
the Cardinal, but he realized at once that she did not
see him, that her vision went beyond him to someone
or something to which she was evidently appealing for
her answer. He saw her look change from one of pleading,
bewildered question to one of instant, calmed
assurance. The great man, watching the girl's face, was
struck with the conviction that some one had spoken to
the girl. He almost caught himself listening, as though
the words might be escaping him.</p>

<p>When she spoke there was a matter-of-fact directness
in her strange words that was so simple as to be startling.</p>

<p>"My mother's spirit," she said quietly, "is not
bound by that body, by that place. She speaks to me.
She tells me that it is right. I know."</p>

<p>The Parish Priest of New York looked gravely at the
girl for a moment. Then he turned to look up through
the unshaded window into the clear breadth of sky that
showed so high above the city's walls. From bedside to
confessional he had gone his round these many years
past. And he had learned that there is more of the
spirit in the teeming streets, in the crowded tenements,
of the city than ever was in the open places, if one but
had the vision and the ear for it. He had seen and
heard many things for which he had not accounted.</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned to Wardwell, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
"Why do you wish to marry the young lady?"</p>

<p>"Because I love her," Wardwell answered so
promptly and bluntly that the Cardinal smiled.</p>

<p>"Were you ever baptized in any church?" the latter
asked, after a little pause.</p>

<p>"I do not think so."</p>

<p>"Have you heard, perhaps, that I have personally
very strong objection to my people marrying those who
are not Catholics?"</p>

<p>"I have heard you say it. Your Eminence must
understand," Wardwell explained, "that some reporter
hears nearly everything that you say in public."</p>

<p>"I am glad to know that that is your business," the
Cardinal said briefly. "Some of my best friends through
long years have been newspaper men of this town.
They are men of wide and sympathetic understanding.
Now," he went on, "has it occurred to you that I have
probably good reasons for opposing such marriages as
the one for which you ask?"</p>

<p>"I do not doubt you have good reasons, your Eminence."</p>

<p>"What might you think to be one of them?"</p>

<p>"I suppose there's enough to fight about," said
Wardwell promptly&mdash;so promptly that he saw the
Cardinal smiling, and felt himself blushing furiously
under the boyish white skin.</p>

<p>"You seem to have acquired a working knowledge,"
said the aged man with his smile, "of&mdash;But let us hope
that it is not so bad as you have been led to believe.
There are other reasons, several of them," he continued
in a different tone. "You will find them all good. But
back of them all there is a very human, very practical
one. It is this. The Catholic party considers himself
bound until death by a divine law. The other party, in
practice, hardly ever considers himself bound by anything
but the law of the land, and a certain vague sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of justice. It is never fair," he ended gravely. "Never a
fair partnership."</p>

<p>Wardwell was silent, thinking of the matter in a light
in which it had not, as a fact, ever occurred to him.
He knew well enough that the average man in his position
would not and did not think that he bound himself
to anything beyond that which was the custom of the
society in which he lived.</p>

<p>"I will only ask you to remember and think of this,
Mr. Wardwell. To a man of just mind it is well worth
thinking of always. My secretary," he went on, as he
touched a button, "will prepare the papers. You can
then go to the city clerk and to your priest. If you
should need help," he added to Augusta in parting,
"in the matter of bringing your mother home, I hope
that you will command me."</p>

<p>The secretary, a young priest with the face of a big,
solemn eyed boy, came and conducted them to an
outer office.</p>

<p>When they were again in the street, Wardwell faced
Augusta and asked:</p>

<p>"Did you ever think of that, what the Cardinal said
at the last?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not," she answered. "It wouldn't affect
us at all, Jimmie?"</p>

<p>She had spoken so quickly and confidently that
Wardwell thought that she had not understood what
the Cardinal had said. But the next moment he knew
that he was entirely mistaken. Augusta understood and
accepted everything with steady, unflinching eyes.</p>

<p>She said:</p>

<p>"I'd never wish to keep even a kitten that wanted to
go away from me."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the evening of the day that they were married,
Rose Wilding came home with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Augusta had managed to dress her into the outward
semblance of her old self. And in everything but the subject
of Augusta she seemed reasonable. That subject they
did not press upon her. And when she wondered why her
little daughter had not come to bring her, they merely
said that Augusta would be waiting for her at home.</p>

<p>Augusta had made absolutely no changes in the
house, trusting that the presence in its own place of
every remembered thing would awaken in her mother
the sense of security and home. And for a little time, as
she watched her mother walking slowly about her own
room, touching a curtain here, a pillow there, as had
been always her busy way, the girl felt sure that it was
going to have just that effect.</p>

<p>But she observed that her mother soon became restless.
She kept glancing over her shoulder and sidewise
at Augusta who sat in her own little low chair which
from childhood had been her favorite seat, just below
the big red post of her mother's bed. She was remembering
now how it used to be the greatest glory of her
day to sit and watch with adoring eyes the combing
out of her mother great waves of wonderful dark brown
hair. It was snow white now, but still abundant and
strangely beautiful.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she said suddenly, "let me take your
hair down and run it through my fingers. Remember,
you used to say it always took away a headache."</p>

<p>Rose Wilding looked suspiciously over her shoulder.
What was running in the poor disordered mind it is
hard to say. But when she turned she spoke kindly and
quietly.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's time you were going back,
child? Wont they be missing you&mdash;there?"</p>

<p>Poor Augusta's heart turned sick with failure. She
threw herself down kneeling at her mother's feet, begging
and crying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
"Mamma, mamma darling can't you remember!
Try to remember. I'm your Augusta! Your little
daughter! Augusta! <i>Augusta!</i>" she cried hysterically,
trying in pitiful futility to pierce the cloud of her
mother's mind by sheer loudness.</p>

<p>But Rose Wilding only smiled with a gentle patience,
and lifted her up, petting her.</p>

<p>"There there, daughter, hush now, hush. I'll let you
stay here. Though I wonder that they'd allow it."</p>

<p>Augusta ran out of the room and came down the long
hall to the common sitting room, where she found
Wardwell at the table reading. She fell into a chair at
his side and dropped her head upon his arm where it
lay extended on the table.</p>

<p>"Jimmie, Jimmie," she cried miserably, "it's no use!
I've failed, failed!"</p>

<p>"No you haven't either," said Jimmie quickly, as he
raised her head and lifted her face up to him. "Of course
there's always a fly in the icebox, kid. But no one has
ever failed when he's done all his part as you have.
And at least you have her here where you can make
her comfortable and can know what's happening to
her."</p>

<p>"I know, Jimmie, I'm happy even for that. But I
was so sure, so sure that she'd know me and be better
right away."</p>

<p>"She is better," said Jimmie stoutly. "Her mind is at
rest, except about you. She is not able to place you.
There is something about you that she has never seen
before. She does not know you."</p>

<p>He stopped short, struck by a sudden thought as he
looked down with quick intensity upon the golden
shot circle of Augusta's head and into the deep, pain
clouded eyes.</p>

<p>When he spoke it was in the slow, rising voice of one
who struggles toward a new and amazing conviction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
"She is right," he said in a low voice. "You are not
her Augusta."</p>

<p>"Why Jimmie, Jimmie," the girl cried in a trembling
voice. "Are you&mdash;&mdash;? What can you mean?"</p>

<p>Wardwell seeing the quick leap of anguish in her
eyes hurried to say lightly:</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, as per usual. Only, you see, when she
went away, you were a little girl with a little curl. And
now&mdash;she can't understand it&mdash;the little girl is a&mdash;woman."</p>

<p>Augusta put her hand softly into Wardwell's palm
and said gently, soberly:</p>

<p>"Your woman."</p>

<p>Wardwell started as though a hot iron had touched
him. The homely expression, in the way she had put it,
and meant it, the gentle dignity of her complete surrender,
went to his heart, and flashed up into his brain
the revelation of the heart holiness that this little girl
had brought today to the ceremony which, after all,
had meant so little to him.</p>

<p>He closed his hand blindly over the little hand that
lay in his, and bowed his head.</p>

<p>A slight rustling noise came from the hall, and
Augusta leaping from her chair ran hastily from the
room and down the hall.</p>

<p>She was in time to look through the railing of the
stairs and see her mother disappearing down the
stairs. She saw her mother look back in a frightened,
furtive way; saw that she recognized her; and then
saw that she turned to flee from her.</p>

<p>Augusta put her arm out blindly to the wall and
leaned against it.</p>

<p>"Go, Jimmie, quick," she moaned. "She'd never
come back for me. She'd only run faster and farther.
She's running away&mdash;Running away from <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>Wardwell hurried down the stairs, and Augusta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
leaning over the railing heard him as he caught up with
her mother on the lower landing.</p>

<p>"Surely," she heard him arguing genially, "you're
not going out this kind of a night! It's going to rain
cats and dogs in another five minutes."</p>

<p>"I can't stay here." The girl heard the hurried
whisper. "It's that girl. They've set her here to watch
me."</p>

<p>"No such thing!" Wardwell contended. "She's
here&mdash;" His voice suddenly dropped to a whisper which
Augusta could not understand. She listened with painful
tenseness, but she could distinguish no words. After a
little, however, she knew that Jimmie's talk was more
steady&mdash;almost continuous; while her mother's whispers
became hesitating and infrequent. Jimmie was winning.
Augusta knew just what he was doing. He was telling
one prodigous and consequential lie after another,
until the poor fumbling mind with which he was contending
should be completely turned around and would
give in to his bidding like a bewildered child. She
choked and almost cried aloud, for the pity of it, though
she knew that Jimmie was doing the only thing possible.
Then her mind wandered for a moment to another
thought, and for an instant she trembled in a cold grip
of fear. Would Jimmie ever, for any reason, find it
necessary to use his&mdash;facility&mdash;upon herself.</p>

<p>At last she heard her mother laugh. Jimmie had won!</p>

<p>She ran quickly into her mother's sitting room and
into the bedroom, shutting the door softly behind her.
Then she went on into her own little room, which was
fitted into a jutting corner of the building, and threw
herself down on the bed. She did not know what she was
going to do, but ever since Jimmie had said that, about
her mother going away and leaving her a little girl, an
idea had been crowding into her mind.</p>

<p>She heard her mother and Wardwell at the hall door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and heard her mother inviting Jimmie into the sitting
room for a little chat. Wardwell had always been a
favorite with her mother, and she spoke in just the
friendly, kindly way she would have spoken in the old
days.</p>

<p>Then she heard her mother come into the big bedroom,
probably to put down her hat and shawl. When
Rose Wilding had gone out and shut the bedroom door,
Augusta thought and acted quickly.</p>

<p>She drew from under her own bed the little old cot
on which she had slept until she was a big girl. Carrying
it out into the big room she carefully set it up at the foot
of her mother's bed, where it had stood until Augusta
had come to the dignity of a room of her own. Then,
bringing bedding for it and fixing it in the old way, she
undressed quickly and curled herself into it.</p>

<p>Through the closed door, in the silence of the house,
for it was the time when nearly all the boarders were
out, she could hear plainly nearly every word said in the
outer room.</p>

<p>The rain&mdash;it had actually begun to rain a little&mdash;was
on Wardwell's mind apparently, for he began a fresh
story with:</p>

<p>"Do you remember the time of the Flood, Mrs.
Wilding?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;not quite, Mr. Jimmie." And Augusta could
almost feel her mother's amused chuckle through the
dark. She had always loved fun. And although she
herself did not talk a great deal she had always liked to
hear the laughter and nonsense of young folks around
her.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, that time, McCarty was up a tree.
And along comes Noah, sailing, decks awash, and the
rain pouring down in gutters.</p>

<p>"'Are ye takin' anny Irish this trip, Sor?' says
McCarty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
"Noah looks at him with a weary eye. Says he,
sorrowfully:</p>

<p>"'I am a sea-faring man, by preoccupation. I have
on board two thousand, three hundred eighty one married
couples. The name of this ship is <span class="smcap">Trouble</span>. Irish&mdash;'
he muttered '&mdash;Irish?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, have a heart, Noah,' says McCarty. 'Sure wan
more can do little harm. Take me on.'</p>

<p>"'I wont,' says Noah.</p>

<p>"'You oant?' says McCarty.</p>

<p>"'I wont,' says Noah.</p>

<p>"'Well, ye can go to Blazes&mdash;It's only a shower,
anyway.'"</p>

<p>Augusta, hysterically stuffing the bed clothes against
her mouth, heard her mother's hearty, pleasant laugh
ring out. And for an instant she thought that her own
little play was real; that she was, indeed, the little girl of
other years lying in her cot and listening to the grown
folks in the other room.</p>

<p>Then her own laughter turned, as laughter will, to
hot, choking tears of fear and trepidation that burned
her throat.</p>

<p>The talk outside ran on pleasantly, naturally; just
such an hour as Wardwell and one or two others of the
boarders had often spent with her mother. Wardwell
loved to tell stories, to run on about himself, about his
lack of money&mdash;it was a tradition of the house, founded
probably on his own authority, that he had but three
socks, one of which he washed every night&mdash;about
the scrapes which he was constantly getting into and
getting out of. He never laughed at the end of one of his
own tales, but always before beginning one he would
break out with a short, provoking laugh to himself, as
though he had just heard a good thing.</p>

<p>It was all so natural, so real, that Augusta, her mind
unconsciously relaxing from the strains of the day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
caught herself almost falling asleep. She heard one after
another of the boarders come up the stairs and stop for a
moment, at the door of the room where the two chatted,
for a rather timid and curious word or two with the
mistress of the house. But with Rose Wilding there was
nothing except the usual and the ordinary. She was in
her own house, her own room, doing as she had done
on any other evening. Her house was making its orderly,
routine way to bed.</p>

<p>Finally Wardwell rose, saying:</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Wilding, it's time honest folk were in
bed, and all rogues were turned out. I'm going before
I'm turned out."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Jimmie, there's worse than you in the
world. But I suppose it's late. I <i>am</i> tired."</p>

<p>Augusta heard the door close behind Wardwell, and
her mother came straight to the bedroom door and
pushed it wide open. The full light from the door fell
straight across the cot where Augusta lay.</p>

<p>She did not stir, pretending to be asleep. She heard
her mother's startled gasp of joy. Then she heard her
hurry to the outer door and call to Wardwell:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Jimmie, Mr. Jimmie, come back! Come
back!"</p>

<p>Wardwell came running back, and Rose Wilding in a
choking whisper told him:</p>

<p>"My little darling! My little Pigeon-pie! She's here!
She's here, just where I left her! Oh, Dear Heart of
God, how I missed her! Come and see, she's sleeping,"
she whispered.</p>

<p>Wardwell came quietly with her to the door and
looked in rather timidly. He did not know quite what to
expect.</p>

<p>He saw a little cot, and curled up in it there was what
seemed a little girl sleeping. Her loose, tumbling hair
had fallen all about the face, and one little hand&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
hand upon which there was no ring&mdash;held a strand of it,
as though the little girl had been playing with her
hair when she fell asleep.</p>

<p>He knew it was his wife. But, remembering his
own first startled impression, he did not wonder that
Rose Wilding, her mind straying in its pain, had gone
back through the years to the little Augusta that had
been.</p>

<p>Rose Wilding went gently over to the cot and knelt
beside it whispering softly. Wardwell stole out of the
room and closed the outer door quietly behind him.</p>

<p>Augusta scarcely dared breathe while her mother
knelt bending over her. Her little play had succeeded, so
far as to set her mother's heart at ease for the moment,
but she was in mortal terror of what the effect would
be if her mother should realize that she was being deceived.</p>

<p>After what seemed an eternity of anxiety, she heard
her mother rise, go out quietly, lock the hall door, and
turn out the light. Then she came back and moved
about quietly in the dark, preparing for bed.</p>

<p>She did not come to the cot again but got quietly
into bed, and in a few minutes Augusta listening to her
breathing knew that she had fallen asleep almost instantly
like a tired, contented child.</p>

<p>When she was sure that her mother was sleeping
soundly, Augusta rose, found a dressing robe and slippers,
and stole like a thief out into the hall.</p>

<p>Wardwell was in the common sitting room, alone.
He did not hear her coming. He was reading, and she
stood a moment in the doorway looking at him, before
she said:</p>

<p>"Jimmie."</p>

<p>He looked up and said, as though he had the words
all ready studied and framed:</p>

<p>"That was nothing less than inspiration, dear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
"I do not know," said Augusta hesitatingly. "I was
very frightened. Is it&mdash;right?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Wardwell simply. "It's right. However it
is in the daytime, when you're dressed, she'll never
leave this house so long as she hopes to find you there,
like that, at night."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;Good night, Jimmie."</p>

<p>"Good night, dear."</p>

<p>She turned away a step or two. Then she turned
quickly back to the door and said:</p>

<p>"Jimmie."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Sometime, when you need it badly, God is going to
be <i>very</i> good to you."</p>

<p>And she was gone.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<p>Rose Wilding did not rise from her bed the next day,
nor, in the daytime, for many days. When she had come
home in the evening she had looked, to the casual eye,
as robust as ever. But in the morning it was plain that
she had fallen into a complete mental and physical
collapse.</p>

<p>It seemed that she must have gone on upon the sheer
strength of terror and worry, until, once finding the
little girl, as she thought, the stimulus was gone; and
her strength and her interest in life had gone with it.
She lay all day like one in a partial doze, evidently not
asleep, but paying no attention to anybody or anything
about her. Augusta she noticed not at all, except to
take from her the food that she brought and to submit
passively to her tidying and washing. Wardwell she
recognized with a brief, passing glimmer of her old
flashing smile, but not even he could arouse her more
than momentarily. To her own doctor, whom Augusta
had called in, she answered quietly, and without seeming
to think that any other explanation was necessary,
that she was resting and that she did not think that she
would get up.</p>

<p>At night when the house had settled into its bedtime
quiet, Augusta stole into the little cot at the foot of her
mother's bed, and waited.</p>

<p>After a little she heard her mother stir softly in the
bed, and then heard her get stealthily out to the floor.
She came straight to the little cot, and, as she knelt by
it, Augusta could feel her warm breath upon her own
tumbled hair. Then, satisfied, she stole softly back into
bed and went sound asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
This was the first day of the new life for Augusta.
And every day that followed through the fall and
winter was exactly like it. It seemed that Rose Wilding
lived through the day just waiting for the night to
come, that she might steal from her bed to find her
little girl. She never spoke to Augusta except to answer
a direct question. She submitted in a gentle, kindly
way to Augusta's every ministration. She smiled at
Wardwell and always knew him. But when he would
time and again, indicating Augusta, ask who this girl
was, she always answered with a deprecating "Hush!"
and a pitying glance at Augusta which said plainly that
he should not ask, that he knew well enough where the
girl had come from and he ought to know better than
to hurt her feelings by bringing it up. He asked the
question often in a good-hearted effort to make her
realize that this was Augusta. But, one day, after he
had asked it, he saw Augusta's face as she caught her
mother's sidelong look. He did not ask the question
again.</p>

<p>Gradually the three settled to an acceptance of the
state of affairs as they existed in the mind of Rose
Wilding. By day, Augusta was the girl that had followed
Rose Wilding from "that place." At night, the
little Augusta came from somewhere and slept in her
place at the foot of her mother's bed.</p>

<p>The change that came over Rose Wilding was one
that to the outer eye was wholly inexplicable. Though
that there was a change was plain to the most casual
look. Probably it was to the casual, unconcerned eye
that the change was most startling.</p>

<p>One day, when Rose Wilding had been some weeks
at home, a new boarder, a Mrs. Barron, a nervous,
high-strung, over-worked woman, head of department
in one of the great retail stores, came into the sitting
room to speak to Augusta. She glanced accidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
into the bedroom and straight into the eyes of Rose
Wilding whom she had never before seen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barron fainted.</p>

<p>Augusta and Wardwell, accustomed to seeing Rose
Wilding day by day, could not realize the extent of the
change that had come over her. To them she was today
practically as she had been yesterday. But to a stranger
the picture of the large handsome woman, her face
blanched now by hidden disease to a transparent pearl
white, the skin smooth and unlined as a growing baby's,
her pallor doubled by the white of the bed and the
enamel that covered every object in the room, was in all
a sight to arouse a nameless, creeping dread of something
present but unseen.</p>

<p>Augusta had taken a few months of hospital training
during the year past, and her care of her mother became
not only a cult and a religion but almost a fanatical
passion. She had turned the room into her ideal
of a hospital room. She had painted and enamelled
everything so that all could be scrubbed and washed
down with disinfectants. She would have nothing in
the room that was not a pure white. She dressed the
bed and her mother in the snowiest things she could
lay hand to.</p>

<p>The effect was not at all what she had had in mind.
To herself, living as she did so close to her mother, the
room was just the cheeriest and sweetest abode that
could be made for a beloved sick one. But her mother's
wondering, childlike eyes, as they looked out unseeing
from under the circle of completely blanched hair
above them upon the room that was now her world, did
not have the look familiar to the sick room. They were
eyes that looking, and seeing not, yet dealt with strange
thing that showed through a curtain.</p>

<p>Augusta, from long watching, from unending longing
and perpetual defeat, had worn thin the coarser material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
covering that held the living, burning spirit within
her. As her mother seemed to remove day by day into
deeper and deeper places of the soul's isolation, Augusta
seemed ever to follow her.</p>

<p>Wardwell, standing by his wife with the feeling of a
strange man watching over a girl baby left suddenly and
unaccountably to his care and at the same time with
the hunger of a young lover for his sweetheart's first
kisses, thought, and thought often, that she was going
away from him.</p>

<p>She was unfailingly dear and thoughtful. The moments
which she could snatch for him from the ever
increasing care of her mother she filled with anxious
and touching tenderness. Every day brought him a new
and revealing sense of the depth of her spirit and
affection. But the feeling of being separated from her
came pressing upon him with a twofold weight.</p>

<p>In the day time she played her part as the girl who
had come from "that place" with Rose Wilding, while
Wardwell looked on heart sick with sympathy for the
pain that he knew she carried and with a withering
sense of his own uselessness. She played a part. But
she played the part so well in her self-effacing patience
that he was finding it necessary to remind himself that
she was playing a part. It came to the point where he at
times caught himself walking rapidly up and down his
room and arguing with himself whether this was really
his Augusta, or whether he, too, was losing his grip on
reality.</p>

<p>At night, when she was away from his sight and he
knew that she had gone back into the little Augusta of
Rose Wilding's memory, it was, if anything, worse.
Here he knew she played a willing part, trying to make
the part a reality. For Wardwell knew the daring of her
mind and the greatness of her desire; knew that she
would stop at nothing, would grasp at every thread of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
memory that could possibly draw her mother's mind
across the vacant wilderness between the present and
the past.</p>

<p>But even this double barrier of outward isolation
from the Augusta who was his was not the great thing
that he feared. The look which he had seen in Augusta's
face in the days when they were hunting the city for her
mother, that strained, listening look that took her
away from him and from everything about them, was
often in her eyes now. Somehow he knew that in it she
spoke to the spirit of Rose Wilding that wandered in the
unknown places.</p>

<p>He did not resent the state of things. But he found
himself unaccountably peevish and unwontedly tempted
to self pity.</p>

<p>He did not know what was coming upon him. Would
not have believed it if he had been told. He knew that
they were bad days for him. They were days in which
he sat pounding out useless hours at the typewriter,
only to destroy the work as soon as he had done it.
They were nights when he worked feverishly, bitterly
at the jokes and skits that were at once his bread and
butter and the bane of his soul.</p>

<p>He came to hate the mere thought of writing at all.
He was a failure. Even the things that he could do, the
hated jokes that until now had brought him enough for
a living, were now failing him. He was not making
enough to afford to take Augusta and her mother away
from this big house. And the thought that Augusta in
the face of all her burdens was obliged to keep it to
support her mother and herself, while he barely paid
his board drove him frantic.</p>

<p>One day in the middle of the winter he climbed to the
coop in the fourth story of the old building in Bleecker
street where the presses were complaining over the
last edition of the afternoon. He had been walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
nearly all day, climbing stairs in increasing discouragement
and going down them again with a certain sickly
relief. He was, in short, looking for work.</p>

<p>Six months before he would have sworn that he
would never again have to go back to the treadmill of
routine work. He had been so sure that he could sit
his whole life, if necessary, and turn out stories and
scraps enough to give him the money he needed. He
had deliberately planned for himself a life in which he
would earn just enough to live in his own way, giving
himself the time to think and work upon the books that
he wanted to write.</p>

<p>His marriage had changed his plan of life. He did not
propose that Augusta and her mother should be dependent
upon the girl's work and the house. It did not
occur to him that Augusta was not, and did not intend
to be, dependent upon him for a living. There was, of
course, a living in the house for herself and her mother,
as there had always been. But that was not Wardwell's
way of looking at the matter. Augusta was his
wife. And it was his immediate business to begin earning
enough money for all three of them.</p>

<p>At once he had begun to crowd himself. For a few
weeks he had found himself earning more money than
he had ever thought possible from his daily work. But
it took him only a short time to flood the market of
Sunday papers which he had built up for himself. He
had not known how thin was the vein which he had
been working. In a certain foolish contempt for the
thing which he did easily he had thought that he could
turn it out mechanically, without heart in it, and in any
quantity. He was sharply undeceived.</p>

<p>The first few batches of stories that came back did
no more than annoy him. But as the refusals became
more and more perfunctory, and more carefully polite,
Wardwell knew, with sickening insight, that his stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
were not even being read by the editors who used to
welcome them.</p>

<p>He knew that he had lost his power through despising
it. He had writhed on in ugly despair, cursing the
facility with which he could still write; for he knew
that it was that very facility which was now his undoing.
He had not hoped, but he had kept on trying.
Now his money was gone and he must find something.</p>

<p>Jim Ray was sympathetic, and heartily sceptical.</p>

<p>"All rot!" he growled. "Stop bitting your finger ends
and ease up a little. Your face looks like a rat's with the
ferret about three jumps behind. Quit it. Borrow some
money. Here, I'm as poor as my own devil but I can
get you some. There's lots of the stuff around somewhere.
Borrow a hundred and go up on a farm somewhere
for a few weeks, and sleep."</p>

<p>"You're all wrong," said Wardwell, still breathing
hard, "there's nothing the matter with me. It's the
confounded stairs here. They're so steep they lean over
backward."</p>

<p>"You need to go easy, I tell you, Jimmie. What you
need is a rest."</p>

<p>"Rest! I haven't done a stroke for six weeks!"</p>

<p>"Probably not. But you've been bending over a
typewriter till the back ribs are sticking into your
lungs."</p>

<p>"What in blazes are you talking about?" said Wardwell
bluffly. "If you want to stall me off, why don't
you give me the usual thing&mdash;'office all full just now,
leave your name and address, we'll call you up if we
need, and so forth?' Was I so useless as that when I
was here?"</p>

<p>"Jimmie," said Ray quietly, "there's plenty of work
here for a man as good as you. But you're not able just
now to do it, and it would kill you to try. Go home and
go to bed, and let your wife take care of you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Wardwell stared at his friend, trying to outface him,
to bluff the thing down by sheer stubbornness. But
there was a sickening, cold weakness at the bottom of his
stomach. He knew that Ray was seeing through him and
finding him out as he had not been able to see himself.</p>

<p>With an odd feeling of curiosity and detachment he
walked over to a little square of mirror that hung on a
pillar at just the right height for Ray to comb his bald
head by. Wardwell took it off the nail and shoved it up
the post about a foot and a half.</p>

<p>He was curious to know what it was in him that Ray
had seen. But there was nothing to be seen, except,
perhaps, a sort of hunted look about the eyes and a
kind of pinched drawing of the nostrils. He did not
look at all like a sick man.</p>

<p>"You're all wrong," he repeated stubbornly. "And
besides, my wife's got something else to do."</p>

<p>Ray only answered quietly:</p>

<p>"How much are you coughing, Jimmie?"</p>

<p>Wardwell looked around sharply, in a turn of sudden
worry. But in a moment he laughed out:</p>

<p>"What the deuce are you doing? Second story work,
along with your other little activities? Of course I&mdash;I
cough a little. But that's just the smoking and the
irritation. Confound you, you'd be coughing bricks if
you'd been sitting at a machine for six weeks without
being able to knock out a good line!"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. But, Jimmie, you'll have to give up
this other idea. You don't look well. You'd never stand
cold and wet and long waiting. You know the dog's life
of a reporter. One good cold would do for you."</p>

<p>"But, I tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jimmie, be sensible for once. Go home and let that
good little girl of yours get a good look at you. If she
doesn't tell you to pack off out of the city for a while,
I'll admit that I'm wrong."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Wardwell stayed a while, arguing mulishly, but Jim
Ray did not move from his position. He would not
agree to help Jimmie to a job because the latter was not
able to work.</p>

<p>At home, he found Augusta tearfully trying to coax
and lift her mother back into bed. As he stood in the
sitting room he could hear the girl pleading:</p>

<p>"Please, please, mamma dear, can't you help just
one little step! I can't lift any more&mdash;Just one little
step!"</p>

<p>Then he heard the sagging of the bed under the
heavy body and he knew that Augusta had accomplished
her task.</p>

<p>Now he remembered what Doctor Gardner had told
him, that this phase of Mrs. Wilding's malady would
come&mdash;not long before the end. She would rouse herself
out of the torpor into which she had settled. Some
vague, unformed fear would probably stir her, and she
would have to be watched. If it was coming now
Augusta must not be left to do this alone. He would
have to find a good strong nurse. He must see Gardner
about it right away. That he had no money did not
occur to him now. In the face of Augusta's need he did
not think of that fact.</p>

<p>Augusta came out suddenly and walked straight
into Jimmie's arms where he stood in the middle of the
room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmie," she said, resting tiredly against him,
"I needed you so! Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just around."</p>

<p>"She had crawled under the bed, Jimmie," said
Augusta choking, "just like some poor wild thing, and
when she looked out at me, <i>Oh!</i> Why, why does she
seem to fear me, to almost <i>hate</i> me sometimes?"</p>

<p>"No, dearest, no," said Jimmie, holding her quiet.
"No, it isn't that at all. There's something we don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
understand. She's in the dark and so are we. Her mind
is struggling to break through, and we cannot help
because we are in the dark too. Outwardly she doesn't
know you. But she does know you, dear, she feels you,
in another way. She knows that her little Augusta is
around her, caring for her. The flesh and the senses are
playing a cruel trick on her poor spirit, dear. But she
does know that you are about her."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmie, do you really believe it? I'm so tired
trying to believe!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I'm as sure as that we are standing here
that she does in some way&mdash;I don't know how&mdash;she
does really feel you. But I'm afraid, dearest that there
is a change coming now. You know Gardner told us to
expect it. And it's going to be cruel hard upon you,
dear. You must not try to do all alone. I'll see Gardner
tonight and we'll get a good strong nurse."</p>

<p>At the word he felt Augusta stiffen resistingly in his
arms and he knew that a struggle was coming.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmie, don't ask me to do that! I couldn't&mdash;I
couldn't give up one little bit of her, not one little
minute to anyone."</p>

<p>"But, dear, you are not able. You are too little for
it."</p>

<p>"I can't help it, Jimmie. You know I can't. You
know how I've waited, every hour of every day, waited
and prayed, for a moment when my darling would
know me&mdash;when she would know that I hadn't left her,
that she hadn't been left to strange, careless people.
And think, Jimmie, think what it would mean to me if
the moment came, even one little flash, and I wasn't
there for her to know me! Jimmie," she said quietly,
turning slowly upon him with that strange, unseeing
light in her eyes, "I think, if my moment should
slip away from me that way&mdash;I think that I should
die."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
And Wardwell, bewildered, silenced, half believing,
knew that he was beaten.</p>

<p>But he did go to see the doctor.</p>

<p>Doctor Gardner's little eyes twinkled behind a cloud
of smoke from a big cigar as Wardwell expounded the
situation at home and told what must be done and
what Augusta must not be allowed to do. When Jimmie
had quite finished the doctor asked with an elaborate
diffidence:</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;Do I understand that you are intending to do
something that Augusta does not want?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;of course&mdash;" Jimmie started to explain.</p>

<p>"I was only going to remark," the doctor went on
serenely, "that, to my personal knowledge, Augusta
began doing things after her own plan on the day she
was born. And, so far as I know, nobody has been able
to change that. You see, the trouble has been that she
has always turned out to be right."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course she's always right," Wardwell
hastened to agree, "but, in this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And, unless you have found a way," the doctor
proceeded, "of changing Augusta, we'll just have to
let her go her own way in this. To be sure, though, we
must try to see that she does not kill herself with the
hard work.</p>

<p>"But how's the book coming on?" he asked suddenly,
sitting up and fixing Wardwell with a sharp, steady
appraisal that Jimmie could almost feel physically.</p>

<p>"Rotten!" said Jimmie, annoyed and sullen, though
he did not know why. "But how did you know&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Augusta was telling me something the other
day, about your walking the floor, and&mdash;one thing and
another. Come inside here a moment," the doctor
commanded, rising brusquely and walking to the door
of his inner office.</p>

<p>As Wardwell closed the double baize-lined, sound-proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
doors of the little consulting room behind him
he felt a sickening assurance that he was going to hear
bad news. But he was mainly irritated and angry with
himself because he now knew that he had been giving
Augusta additional worry.</p>

<p>A half hour later he was listening restlessly to Doctor
Gardner's explanations about 'filtration in the upper
right lobe' and 'weakening of the walls' and gathering
in a general way that he was well on the way to being a
consumptive. He was telling himself quietly that he did
not believe a word of it, that if he could just once
strike his stride on a good little story he would be all
right in a week.</p>

<p>Finally the doctor prescribed. "You will have to
get out of the city at once. Just walk out, don't fuss
about it, and go south somewhere, where you can stay
out in the open and just lie around and eat and sleep.
Don't take work with you, and don't let it follow you.
Just walk out and drop everything but the business of
saving your life. That's just what I mean, young man.
I have not concealed anything from you. And&mdash;I'm not
exaggerating anything. You must do this <i>now</i>, tomorrow."</p>

<p>Saying nothing, Wardwell rose to go. Inwardly he
was grumbling to himself that it was always easy for
the other fellow to tell you to drop everything and walk
away. But he knew that he could not be churlish. The
doctor was probably right and certainly he was honest
and friendly. They shook hands in silence, and the
doctor, used to seeing people take their news in all
sorts of ways, let him go without another word.</p>

<p>Augusta had once said that Jimmie sometimes was
not quite grown up. Outside in the street he proved it.
He turned deliberately and looking up at Doctor
Gardner's window, much after the manner of a boy
sticking out his tongue in defiance, he said aloud:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
"You can go to the devil. I wouldn't leave Augusta
now, not to save ten lives."</p>

<p>As an afterthought, before reaching home, he went
into a drug store and called the doctor on the telephone.
He warned him truculently:</p>

<p>"Tell her my nerves are bad, that's true enough. Tell
her any tale you like. But don't tell her&mdash;what you've
just told me. I won't have Augusta worried now."</p>

<p>He would not expect to hide it long from Augusta, if
there was anything seriously wrong with him. She
always knew the truth, somehow. But he did not believe
literally what the doctor had told him, and he was
confident that things could drift on as they were.</p>

<p>"In fact," he said to himself as he walked along in the
face of the sharp night wind, "I feel better this minute
than I have for a long time. That's just natural contrariness,
I suppose."</p>

<p>Augusta was waiting for him, sitting wrapped in a
heavy dressing robe reading under the lamp in her
mother's sitting room. She was so like a tired little girl
that as his glance momentarily followed the stream of
the light into the mother's room and fell upon the little
cot drawn up and ready at the side of the mother's bed,
Wardwell for an instant lost his grip on reality. The
fiction at which Rose Wilding's poor wandering mind
had grasped seemed to be actually the truth. And
Wardwell found that he had to struggle with himself
before he could remember that Augusta was truly his
wife and that she and he had an existence for each
other which did not depend on that fiction. But when
he looked again at Augusta and saw the woman in her,
the steady, self-contained, gentle strength that shone
in the beauty of her tired eyes, he knew that Augusta
was really his. And now for the first time he weakened,
his knees bent under him, he felt and was the sick man.
He wanted to tell her, to confide, to lean upon her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Angrily he shook the feeling off and came quickly over
to sit on the arm of her chair.</p>

<p>"You had him all fixed!" he began accusingly, thinking
to head off with banter the question in her eyes.
"The first thing he said was that you got up and rearranged
the parlor furniture and fired the cook and
fixed the furnace the very day you were born&mdash;well,
I couldn't swear that he mentioned the furnace in so
many words. But that was the general idea. You've
always had your own way, and everybody else's way.
And you always will. And he turned me out, laughing
at me for thinking that I could change things."</p>

<p>"What else did he say, dear?" she asked with a quiet
smile of full understanding. "About you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was just like the fellow that went to the doctor
and said he was sick.</p>

<p>"'Stop smoking.'</p>

<p>"'But, doctor, I never smoked in my life.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, I see. Then that's just what you need. Start
smoking. My usual fee is ten dollars&mdash;but&mdash;ah&mdash;considering&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"<i>Jimmie!</i>"</p>

<p>"Honest! Cross my heart! Hope to die of a broken
leg! It was just like that.</p>

<p>"He told me that I had to take a rest. I told him I
hadn't worked for weeks. Then he told me that whatever
I was doing I should stop it."</p>

<p>"You are not telling me what he really said," Augusta
commented.</p>

<p>"Oh, big words, all big long ones, that might have
meant polygamy or liver trouble for all I knew. But
the upshot of it was just what I knew before. I'm
nervous and my temper is bad. And he must have
known that I didn't have any money, for he really
didn't ask me for any," he confessed gracelessly as an
afterthought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
"But it's just as I told him. If I could only rap out a
decent few lines I'd be all&mdash;"</p>

<p>A sharp fit of coughing came up, choking him. He
rose and hurried out into the hall. Augusta started to
follow him, but a movement in the bedroom caught
her ear and she turned back. She wanted to follow him,
to make him tell her just what was the trouble. But the
fear of what her mother might do was too strong upon
her.</p>

<p>For the time, Wardwell had escaped. In his own
room, he sat down at the desk, gasping between spells
of coughing and trying to smother the noise with his
handkerchief. The coughing stopped after a little, and
he was surprised to feel a sensation of pleasant warm
moisture in his irritated throat.</p>

<p>He cocked one ear up in a funny way he had, as
though to listen. Then put his handkerchief to his lips
and held it there a moment. When he drawn it away and
looked meditatively for a little while at the red blotch
on it, he nodded his head.</p>

<p>He did not take this fresh piece of news argumentatively,
defiantly, as he had met the words of the doctor.
This was definite, conclusive. He must deliberate. He
decided that he would deliberate. That was the thing.
This matter must be thought out carefully.</p>

<p>He looked at the typewriter in front of him, for
counsel. Then suddenly his arms shot out grabbing the
rusted iron frame of the typewriter and hugging it,
while his head sank down upon it and he whispered to
it in agony:</p>

<p>"God! Never another good line on you!"</p>

<p>This has to be told. In that moment, that battered
old contraption of cast iron and rattling keys was more
to Jimmie Wardwell than woman, man or child could
be. It was dearer to him, it was nearer to where he
thought and really lived. And he loved it and hugged it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to him, as though already they were trying to take
part of his soul from him. For men of Wardwell's kind
are like that. When the passion of creating has once
gotten fire in their souls, they are damned to live this
life alone. No articulate being can come near. And in
their loneliness they fasten on something connected with
their passion. There have been men who have loved to
the death a rickety old table at which they have
worked, or even a corner of a garret room.</p>

<p>After a while Jimmie lurched up out of his chair and
fumblingly got ready to crawl into bed. It was the first
time that he had missed going down to say good night,
but he dared not face Augusta tonight.</p>

<p>The idea of dying, physically, meant little or nothing
to him. He had never thought of it. He did not think of
it now. But the failures of the past months and this
last sure sign of physical failure, of the end in fact,
threw him into blind panic; not a panic in fear of pain,
or darkness, still less of punishment. No, it was the
fear that the spirit fire, burning pent up and mad
within him, was to be smothered. He was afraid, afraid
that he, Jimmie Wardwell, would be snuffed out before
he could form and bring out the things that burned
within him and craved for expression.</p>

<p>Shivering under the bed clothes, he moaned over and
over like a hurt child: "Never another good line!" Until,
again like a child in pain, he fell into a sort of sleep.</p>

<p>He did not hear, probably he had forgotten, the girl
who came with trembling steps and beating heart to
listen at his door for this breathing and then hurried
back in anxious fear to her own endless vigil.</p>

<p>A Wardwell debonair and blithe as the early spring
morning came into Augusta's sitting room after breakfast.
He had swept from him all traces of the storm of
the night, and Augusta knew from the first glance that
she would learn nothing from him in this mood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p class="bm0 nostanza">"The glory of the morning,</p>

<p class="p0 bm0 nostanza">"The beauty of the dawning,</p>

<p class="p0 bm0 nostanza">"The joy of the skies,</p>

<p class="p0 bm0 nostanza">"Lies in her eyes&mdash;and lies&mdash;and lies&mdash;and&mdash;Oh,</p>

<p class="p0 nostanza">"Well, maybe it only fibs,"</p>

<p>He chanted impudently.</p>

<p>Augusta was standing at the table fixing fruit for her
mother. As Jimmie came up behind her she lifted up her
face to be kissed. But as Jimmie stooped she quickly
lifted the peeled peach she held in her hand and stuck
it full into his mouth.</p>

<p>"Aawa&mdash;yab yab&mdash;yak!" Jimmie expostulated.
Then, when he was articulate:</p>

<p>"Peaches is peaches, I'll admit. But some peaches is
witches, you'll admit. Anyhow, I <i>won't</i> be kissed now
till I've had a bath," he wound up defiantly.</p>

<p>"Come in to see mother," said Augusta serenely.</p>

<p>Rose Wilding lay propped among the snowy pillows
and took no notice whatever of them as they came in.
Her rounded face and beautiful, long, capable hands
were as white as were the masses of lovely white hair
that flowed down past her temples. Only her great
dark blue eyes showed a bit of color. They looked
straight ahead, alive, and full of knowledge, but a
knowledge that seemed to have nothing to do with this
present business of living. Wardwell was struck this
morning more than ever by the look of complete detachment
and absorption in the eyes. He had never
thought much of souls as apart from bodies. But with
the writing man's unconscious trick of always trying to
put even the vaguest, most fugitive thoughts into
words, he found himself trying to word the nameless
idea. Here was a soul, he thought, living quite detached
and almost independent in a beautiful and almost useless
body. And he saw no reason at all why this soul, so
independent, so complete to itself, could not at will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
leave the unnecessary body and go on about its own
absorbing business.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was urging:</p>

<p>"She made me eat half of your fruit already, Mrs.
Wilding, and if you don't hurry and eat the other half,
why, she'll make me eat it all, just to save it."</p>

<p>"Yes, eat up good, darling," Augusta urged gently,
with the way that was now growing upon her of petting
a child. "And don't mind him. You know I wouldn't
give him even a little tiny bit of your fruit."</p>

<p>"Oh, good morning, Mister Jimmie," said Rose
Wilding, in the quick apologetic way of one who has
momentarily forgotten a politeness. "I hope the book
is coming on well."</p>

<p>She had not spoken before for weeks. Wardwell
was startled completely off his guard and the sudden
mention of the book caught him on the raw and
brought back the hideous, shamed cowardice of the
night.</p>

<p>Augusta, looking quickly up at him in her own surprise,
saw the agony and bitterness in his face, and
wondered. Jimmie was never bitter. Then she saw his
face clear, and she knew that whatever it was he had
fought it down.</p>

<p>"Fine and dandy," he lied glibly, "only"&mdash;he paused
a moment with one ear turned up whimsically, as though
considering how best to place the difficulty before
her&mdash;"only there's a Scotchman in it and he's the contrariest
man I ever had to deal with. He's Scotch and he
insists on talking a great deal, which is all wrong for a
Scotchman. But, what's worse, he will talk with a North
of Ireland accent. You see, the two brogues are so much
alike, and I can't get him to stick to his own."</p>

<p>Rose Wilding reached daintily for a quarter of a
peach and commented helpfully:</p>

<p>"I mind I knew an Eyetalian once that talked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the softest Kerry brogue you ever heard. I guess they
caught him young somewhere."</p>

<p>Wardwell shouted uproariously, and Augusta laughed
out in quick surprised happiness. Never since the very
first had her mother spoken so naturally and like her
dear self of other days.</p>

<p>While Augusta turned away a moment, Wardwell
was watching her mother. She was smiling with the
contagion of their laughter, but she had her eye fixed
calculatingly upon Augusta. When she seemed to be
convinced that it was safe, that Augusta would not
turn immediately to see her, she reached out hastily and
snatching a banana from the tray hid it under a pillow
beside her. Then she looked up furtively, to see if
Wardwell had seen her.</p>

<p>He winked and smiled at her, as one who compounds
the felony of a friend and brother. She laughed a little
confused, deprecating laugh, like a child caught in
some new delinquency. Augusta looked around, glancing
from her mother to Wardwell, but she saw nothing.
And Jimmie never told her. He understood. Rose
Wilding had always had a good appetite. And she loved
fruit. She had spent some time in that place on the
Island, where it was said that the attendants took all
of the best that was intended for the patients. Hunger,
or at least the fear of hunger had taught her to do that.</p>

<p>When he looked again he saw that the curtain had
fallen. It was as though the spirit of Rose Wilding
which for a few minutes had stirred the body and the
senses to life had now gone. Only the eyes remained
alive, looking, looking not at Wardwell, not at the wall,
but at some problem, some question of another existence.</p>

<p>Augusta, understanding instantly, did not try to
arouse her mother again. Resignedly, she took up the
tray and went silently from the room. And Wardwell
followed without a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Not again, until the very last, did Rose Wilding open
her lips to speak.</p>

<p>Day by day her response to the promptings of life
grew less and less. With what seemed a deliberate
purpose her spirit refused to know anything of what
went on about her. It was as though she definitely
turned her back upon life. She did not suffer. She had
left all that behind and was going her own way, unmolested
by the useless body.</p>

<p>To Wardwell the sight of the helpless, almost deserted
body was sometimes uncanny. To Augusta,
however, living as she did and had always done so
close to the soul of her mother, these things did not
greatly matter. That her mother did not speak to her,
did not even look at her, was not now so hard to bear.
Though she loved the big beautiful, baby-like body and
petted it as she would have fondled a baby, yet she was
able to realize that she must soon give it up. So that, by
degrees and without consciousness of it, she dropped
the mediums of the senses and found herself slipping
easily and naturally over into that strange border land
where her mother lived.</p>

<p>Wardwell was not fighting any longer. He had accepted
what he thought was fate. He did not argue. He
did not look farther for work.</p>

<p>"I shall now," he said, sitting down deliberately at
his machine, "'proceed,' as they say aboard-ship&mdash;I
wonder why does a navy man always say he 'proceeded'
to the deck and 'proceeded' to the bottom of
the ammunition well? He just ran out on deck, and he
probably fell down the stairs in the other case, but he
'proceeded'&mdash;I shall, therefore, proceed to write jokes
till I choke.</p>

<p>"The suffering public? Well, the public always suffers.
What do I care for them, or it, or him&mdash;whichever
it is. Must be him, I guess. The women only read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the corn cure ads and the hair tonic miracles with which
the advertising editor garnishes the funny page. Hang
it! I never appreciated that fellow. I thought he was a
low commercial bounder on that page. Nothing of
the kind. He belongs there. His ads are just as old and
reliable and well thumbed as any of the other jokes."</p>

<p>With a grin on his face he went to work, humming:</p>

<p class="bm0 nostanza">"Rip Van Winkle was a piker,</p>

<p class="p0 nostanza">"There are some folks sleeping yet."</p>

<p class="in0">And because he had put off the worry that had been
harping at him he found the work coming true and
easy. He forgot the book and his big dreams, half way
happy if he could earn enough to prevent his being
an added burden to Augusta. And because he now did
not greatly care, because he left the whole business on
the knees of whatever gods had cared to meddle with
his affairs, the work began to pay well.</p>

<p>Three separate eddies of life moved quietly about
their round in the house. Ann the cook had taken the
reins of authority from Augusta's hands and was now
ruling the boarding house with a competent and jealous
care. The boarders did not like her, but they knew that
she was honest and remorselessly fair and that there was
no appeal from her judgments. There were no complaints
and the outward business of the house went on
smoothly and decorously as always. In the two rooms
that were now the world of Augusta and her mother
everything circled about the dim little pale flame of
life in her mother which Augusta was feeding with her
love. And in his own room Wardwell worked craftily on,
going softly, husbanding his strength from day to day,
paying it out painfully, like a miser bit by bit, at the
machine, making every bit count for some work done,
and jealously guarding his growing weakness from
Augusta's eyes. She must know before very long, he
realized. But, well, who could tell what might happen?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
And in the meantime there was a little work to be done
each day. Each line of it would be a help to her in the
end.</p>

<p>So the three eddies of life went quietly around,
touching each other and lapping a little upon each other,
but each one a world by itself. Spring came and slipped
well along into May, the street cries changed, the
glistening pavements began to throw the heat back up
into the house, and the threat of a blistering summer
came upon the air. The three little worlds in the
house went on so quietly, so unobtrusively, that it
seemed that they might have been forgotten, that they
might go on indefinitely, that they had been left out of
any scheme of change.</p>

<p>But the change came, swift and disturbing as though
it had never been expected.</p>

<p>Wardwell heard the cry come up in the still night
from the room below him. He had been sitting in the
dark, thinking of nothing, his mind at loose ends, but
he knew Augusta's cry and recognized in it the trembling,
very human fear of death.</p>

<p>As he came to the door of Rose Wilding's room he
saw Augusta half kneeling on the bed holding fast to her
mother's hands. To Wardwell it seemed that Rose
Wilding was making a quivering, feeble struggle to
rise. But Augusta evidently knew different. She was
pleading in a desperate, pitiful whisper:</p>

<p>"Don't go! Please, darling mamma, don't go till
you've known me, just for one little minute! I wont
try to keep you, darling, I know you want to go. But
just look at me once, so that I can see that you know
your own Augusta, please darling."</p>

<p>The hands that Augusta held stopped their quivering
struggle and Rose Wilding lay quiet, as though
listening. Then slowly, naturally, she opened her eyes
with the sweet clear light of perfect reason shining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
gently in them. And she said in a tender, confiding
whisper:</p>

<p>"Augusta, my own. Stay close to me. It's&mdash;it's
lonely&mdash;going." With a sigh as of a tired child she
closed her eyes and seemed to try to cuddle to the
warmth of the young body that was close to her. Then
she lay quite still.</p>

<p>After a little Wardwell gently lifted Augusta away.
She did not resist, nor did she break out weeping as he
had been almost hoping that she would do. Instead, she
leaned against him, begging for full assurance:</p>

<p>"She <i>did</i> know me, didn't she, Jimmie!"</p>

<p>"Of course, dear, of course she did."</p>

<p>Then Augusta went slowly over to the little cot
which had been her partner in the play of the weary
pitiful months and began folding it away.</p>

<p>Through the two days that followed Wardwell did
all the necessary things with a calculated care that
showed how well he had schooled himself. He saw to
everything, anticipated everything, exerting himself
more than he had done for weeks, yet always carefully
holding himself within the limits of his strength lest a
sudden breakdown should come to frighten Augusta.</p>

<p>It was only on the lonely ride back from the cemetery,
through the sand pitted lots and broken streets of
Greenpoint and across the ferry, that Jimmie began to
go to pieces. He was tired, tired of the struggle to keep
up, tired of the silly pretense of being a normal, cheery,
good hearted fellow. Besides, Augusta did not seem to
have needed him. She had not broken down. She
would, he thought, have done just as well without him.
And he began to pity himself inordinately.</p>

<p>Now he was sure that Augusta was looking at him in a
thoughtful, speculative sort of way. Although he knew
well enough that Augusta was not aware of his condition,
yet it took only a few minutes of this bent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
thought to convince him fully that she was wondering
what in the world she could do with a hopelessly sick
husband on her hands.</p>

<p>The foolish, overweaning egotism of a sick mind in a
sick body took sway over him, making him forget
everything but his own morbid line of thoughts. Augusta
did not need him. He was of no use to her, or to
anybody. He never would, in fact, be of any use. It
would be better to let it end now. He had never really
been Augusta's husband. He had served her as well as he
could. But that was over now. She did not need him
now. He pressed his self inflicted hurt home and took a
sort of miserable pleasure from the pain. She at least
could be happy. Why should he drag her down the long
dark path with himself. He might live on and on for a
deuce of a while&mdash;people did, you know. No, he was not
going to let the poor girl in for anything like that.</p>

<p>The heady, self-centred resolution took shape rapidly,
and he began to fill it in with all sorts of reasonable and
thoughtful advantages.</p>

<p>He would drop out now, today, while things were
still in their present state. If he waited at all, Augusta
would at once find out his condition and she would&mdash;he
knew her&mdash;immediately break up her house and pack
off with him to wherever the doctors told her to take
him. And he would be unable to resist once she took
hold. Then, in the inevitable end, she would have spent
on him whatever money she had&mdash;he had never thought
to wonder whether it was much or little, or any&mdash;her
home and her way of living would be gone. He would be
gone. And she would be alone, among strangers, with
no way of making a living, probably broken down from
nursing him&mdash;He drew the whole picture and elaborated
upon it.</p>

<p>Yes he must drop out today, quietly, without a word,
and just drift&mdash;drift on over towards oblivion. Augusta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
would miss him, but she would not really need him.
It would be all very simple. A short time, maybe only a
few days, of knocking around and he would be completely
down sick. Then some hospital or other would
pick him up, under any name he happened to be able to
think of, and&mdash;and everything would settle itself without
fuss. He particularly did not want any fuss. He was
tired and he had found a way to avoid all bother.</p>

<p>He turned smiling cheerily to Augusta. He found her
looking at him, studying him with a grave, and, somehow,
a different, interest.</p>

<p>Augusta had found herself face to face with a problem
of her own.</p>

<p>She had known for a long time that there was something
pressing on Jimmie's mind. She knew, of course,
that he was not altogether well. But, with her own
wonderful health and soundness, she could not think
of mere illness as the cause of his trouble. She was sure
that the trouble was in his heart. He had not been the
same since they had known definitely that her mother
must so go.</p>

<p>Was that his trouble? He was, in a way, free now.</p>

<p>He had been kind and dear. He had done all that she
had asked him&mdash;Yes, she remembered now with confusion,
she had literally <i>asked</i> him. And he had done
everything that she had needed and more than he had
promised.</p>

<p>Did he want to go now?</p>

<p>If he did, she must make him go. For she knew well
enough, she thought, that Jimmie would never let her
know that he wanted to go. He would just stay on and be
kind and say nothing. But she must not let him do that.</p>

<p>Yet, with all her reasoning and searching, Augusta
was first a woman. There was just one question, and
she knew it. With the simple, terrible directness of a
child she put it to herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Did he love her? She had never known, really. He
was so kind, and so good an actor.</p>

<p>They were alone now, for the first time. There was
now no one, nothing that they had to think of but
themselves.</p>

<p>Fearless and direct as she was, Augusta quivered
with the dread of parting, for she had come to love the
very thought of Jimmie's nearness. But she knew that
they were now facing the elementary facts of life.
Childlike, she had not anticipated this hour. She saw
now with a startling and vivid reality that, for the
sake of both their lives, she must <i>know</i>, before another
day, whether Jimmie loved her as a man must love a
woman.</p>

<p>A forgotten and unbidden memory came to her in
that instant, and although she did not imagine that it
had any bearing upon her problem she grasped it and
brought it out into the light, never thinking where the
consequences might lead.</p>

<p>"Jimmie," she said, turning quickly, "maybe you
won't remember, but one day last September I saw you
in the Square talking to a lady. She had been driving
along in an automobile, and she saw you and called to
you. Then she drove the machine up to the curb and
stopped, and you came and stood with your foot on the
running board. While you talked she seemed to be
pleading with you about something. Who was she?"</p>

<p>"Ah-ha!" said Jimmie gaily. "At last! I am now an
accredited and confirmed husband. My wife has begun
to delve into my dark past. I am now a married man!
Listen, my dear, and I will unfold unto thee a tale:</p>

<p>"That lady&mdash;and she was a tall dark lady, mind
you&mdash;was actually trying to pay me back borrowed
money! Did you ever hear the like?"</p>

<p>"She'd borrowed money from <i>you</i>?" said Augusta,
with thoughtless emphasis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
"Does sound like a joke, doesn't it," Jimmie admitted,
with just a tinge of bitterness in his voice.
Augusta had unwittingly touched the sore spot which
he himself had just been prodding. "But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean that! Please forgive me, Jimmie,
I didn't mean it that way at all!"</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Jimmie lightly. "I can explain.
There had been a time when she was not as prosperous
as she appeared that day. And there also had been
times&mdash;short and fleeting as they were&mdash;times when I
had plenty of money. Therefore." He turned his hands
out before him in a sort of Latin way, as though nothing
could be plainer.</p>

<p>Augusta sat back, saying nothing. She was sorry that
she had spoken now, and about this. Jimmie, she felt,
had told the literal truth. And the incident seemed to
make it more difficult to lead up to the things which
she must say today.</p>

<p>They rode to the door in silence, both subdued by the
nearness of a crisis which each foresaw in a different
way. As the lugubrious coach drove away they stood
on the sidewalk looking after it, both half conscious
that it was the last vestige of an existence with which
they were now finished. When it had trundled around
the nearest corner and disappeared they turned to each
other and, instinctively, like two solemn, slightly
frightened children, took hands and went stealing up
the steps.</p>

<p>Augusta did not miss Wardwell until evening. When
he did not appear for supper, she ran up the stairs to
bring him, thinking that he had perhaps fallen asleep.
She had been busying herself through the afternoon,
putting off the inevitable. And now she decided that it
could be put off for still a little longer. She need not
speak just yet.</p>

<p>His door stood open, but Jimmie was not there. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
wondered that he should have gone out today, for she
knew he was tired. But, maybe, he had just gone down
to the street, and perhaps he would be coming in any
minute. She lingered a little, looking around at the
signs of Jimmie's ways&mdash;a pair of shoes in the middle
of the floor, a coat draped perilously from the arm of a
chair, a necktie festooning a doorknob, for Jimmie,
while he was always wholesomely clean, was certainly
not orderly. And then the loose, scrambled piles of
papers all over his desk. She had often wanted to fuss
among them, to straighten them out and make neat
piles of them. But she had learned that this was one of
the points on which Jimmie would fight. Anyone might
hide his shoes away or hang up his coat or take his
neckties away to press, but touch that desk and he
would roar. And she had always understood and loved
the little boyish jealousy with which he guarded everything
he wrote until it was printed.</p>

<p>She went over on tiptoe, to take just a peep at what
was on the typewriter.</p>

<p>As if he had known that she would do just this, the
words flashed cruelly up at her from the middle of the
white paper:</p>

<p>"I am going away, on urgent business&mdash;I am very
tired."</p>

<p>Augusta sank down into the chair, covering the
words with her arm, sobbing:</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmie, Jimmie, did you have to hurt me this
way! I wouldn't have tried to hold you. I would have
let you go, and blessed you for the dear good boy you've
been to me. I know you were tired. But you didn't
need to hurt me!"</p>

<p>After a little she sat up and forced herself to look at
the line of words as they stared up at her. And as she
studied them she found herself listening for the sound of
Jimmie's voice saying them. Then she knew why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Jimmie had written the words instead of saying them
to her.</p>

<p><i>She would not have believed him.</i> And Jimmie had
known that.</p>

<p>Word by word and tone by tone, she made him say it
over to her mind's ear and eye, even to the little lift in
his shoulder with which he would have ended&mdash;And
she knew!</p>

<p>Jimmie did not mean that at all. He did not want
to go away from her!</p>

<p>"Urgent business!" Love laughed up in her heart.
Jimmie and urgent business!</p>

<p>And then the quiet, thinking Augusta came back.
This was no caprice, no mere whim of Jimmie's. He had
tried to make her believe that he was tired and only
wanted escape. He had deliberately tried to hurt her
so that she would believe. Jimmie would not have done
that without a powerful reason.</p>

<p>And he was gone. Nothing could be more definite
than that. If she had seen him packing trunks for a
week his going could not have been so convincing. He
had simply changed into his everyday street suit and
walked out, humming:</p>

<p class="bm0 nostanza">"The Priest of the Parish,</p>

<p class="p0 bm0 nostanza">"The Clerk and his man</p>

<p class="p0 bm0 nostanza">"Went 'round the church yard</p>

<p class="p0 nostanza">"With a red hot brick in his han'."</p>

<p>Augusta rose and stole to the door to peer down the
stairs, half frightened by the distinctness of her image
of him. The impression that she had gotten, of Jimmie
walking down the stairs, hands in pockets, humming
that tuneless old rhyme of his, had been so vivid that for
the moment she had thought it real, had believed that
she was hearing and seeing Jimmie go down the stairs.</p>

<p>The blank unconcern of the stairway looking back
at her chilled her. Jimmie was gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
A sudden feeling of physical weakness that came
over her now brought up to her one thing that she had
overlooked. She remembered that she had never really
found out what Dr. Gardner had said to Jimmie that
night when he had gone to see him. Jimmie had baffled
her with many words, both wise and foolish. And the
doctor had not told her anything definite. They had
both treated her as they would have answered a child.
But that was different, then she had been living only for
her mother.</p>

<p>Now the conviction came to her that the key to
Jimmie's action was to be found in his talk that evening
with the doctor. He had never really been the same
since. So it was a quiet, determined Augusta who
faced the doctor that evening.</p>

<p>"I told him that he was in very bad shape and that
he would be worse if he didn't get out of the city at
once. That was some weeks ago. But I imagine he went
away laughing at me a little. He seemed to have some
absurd notion that you needed him, that he was helping
you by staying." Doctor Gardner wasted no words, for
he did not feel that he was any longer bound by the
promise of silence that he had made to Wardwell.</p>

<p>"I needed him every moment," said Augusta slowly;
"and he stayed until he had done everything."</p>

<p>"Stayed? Has he gone now?"</p>

<p>"No no," said Augusta quickly. "I was just thinking&mdash;That
was all." Suddenly it seemed to her that she
must not on any account admit that Jimmie had gone
away. She must find him now, tonight. She must not
let it become established that he had gone at all.</p>

<p>"Of course, you should have let me know," she went
on hurriedly. "But then, I know Jimmie. He just talked
you into keeping it from me. He can talk anybody into
anything if he sets his mind to it. Now I must get home
right away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
She was already on her way to the door, and the
doctor, although he had helpful advice ready to offer
her, did not try to detain her. He saw that, just now,
she wanted nothing but to get away. So he followed her
resignedly to the street door, only saying:</p>

<p>"You know that if you need me in any way&mdash;"</p>

<p>From the steps she turned and, not trusting herself
to speak, grasped his hand impulsively. Then she was
gone.</p>

<p>As he stood looking down into the dusk after her, he
wondered why she turned west, away from her home.
He cleared his throat, to call after her.</p>

<p>But, well, she had always done things herself, in her
own way. And she was always right.</p>

<p>Augusta did not know that Wardwell a few hours
earlier had sauntered just this way that she was hurrying.
She did not know as she crossed West street, now
silent and deserted as a country road, that Jimmie had
walked recklessly through its roaring traffic, weakly half
hoping that something would happen to him. She did
not know that he had stood just where she came to
stand, looking down over the railing into the slip between
two docks, asking questions of the lapping water.</p>

<p>A dock watchman who stood within a few feet of her
put his lantern out of his hand, merely as a precaution.
She did not look like any of the many kinds that he had
seen coming to look too curiously at the water. But, she
was in trouble. Happy people do not come peering down
into rivers. He cautiously moved a little closer to her.</p>

<p>Then she turned and, without so much as a look back,
crossed the street again and turned north.</p>

<p>"Whatever she was lookin' for," the watchman
grumbled, "it wasn't here."</p>

<p>Augusta was not thinking or reasoning, or consciously
searching for Jimmie. She had loosened her mind, as it
were, and was letting herself drift in his wake. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
understood him now. She knew now what he had been
going through. She was following every thought of his
as it had worked through his brain and had turned out
into action. She was feeling with him and suffering the
hurt that he had felt. But she was not following him
now because she pitied him. It was not because she
wished to care for him, to mother him, to make good
her debt to him.</p>

<p>She was following him now because she loved him.
Up to now she had needed him, his protection, his
kindness, his dear thoughtfulness and his cheer. Now
she needed him because she had found out, in this last
half hour, that she loved him with a desperation that
would have frightened her if she had been able to think
of it. She did not care whether he was sick or well. She
did not care whether he wanted to stay or go. She would
find him. She would hold him. She would not stop
walking until she had found him. And then she would
put her arms around him. And not any other woman,
nor even death itself would get him from her.</p>

<p>Now she knew that she was on the right way. Her
start towards the river had been a false one, just as
Jimmie's had been. Jimmie had had no more real
thought of harming himself than she had had of finding
the end of her search in the river.</p>

<p>He had just set himself adrift aimlessly, and unconsciously
she seemed to know that mere physical weariness
would bring him to where all the drifting logs of
the city's stream sooner or later come to rest, the park
benches.</p>

<p>Through the endless night she trudged, scanning the
thousand figures that weariness and misery and failure
take when they finally slump down to the friendly darkness
of a shaded bench.</p>

<p>Policemen looked sharply after her. Good men
looked wonderingly after her. Bad men looked discriminatingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
after her. Her soul was sick with the
misery and the sordidness that she searched among.
But her heart was not afraid. She was right, and love
was at the end of her search.</p>

<p>In the gray, haggard dawn she saw him at a little
distance, sitting jauntily erect, his hand extended resting
lightly on his cane, peering interestedly up into the
coming light of the new day&mdash;as though he had that
moment sat down to enjoy the fresh morning and to
wonder at the miracle of dawn.</p>

<p>Augusta trembled in every aching nerve, but her heart
laughed as she stole toward him. It was so like him,
sitting up making a play at interest, when, as she knew,
he probably didn't care whether the day dawned or not.</p>

<p>Then with a little desperate run she was kneeling on
the bench beside him and had fairly dragged his head
into her arms and was kissing him wildly, passionately.</p>

<p>Now Wardwell said not a word. He did not at first
seem surprised. It is doubtful if, knowing Augusta and
remembering her actions in those days when her mother
had been lost, he really had thought that he could lose
himself from her in the way he had taken.</p>

<p>But when he found Augusta's arms tight around him
something within him awoke with a start. Augusta had
kissed him before this&mdash;But&mdash;</p>

<p>Jimmie Wardwell knew as little of women's love and
the ways of it as most men do. But he suddenly straightened
up and deliberately pulled one of Augusta's arms
away and caught her little face in his hand and looked
boldly, hungrily down into her eyes.</p>

<p>For a little while, unashamed and fearless, her eyes
gave him back his answer. Then her lashes dropped in
surrender, and Wardwell, as though life and strength
had suddenly been poured into him, caught her up
bodily to him and hugging her tight started to carry
her to the nearest street.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<p>"Donahue," said Jimmie earnestly, "you may be
frank. We do not invite criticism, but we can stand
observation. What, then, after two thoughtful days, is
your fairly honest opinion of this&mdash;ah&mdash;institution, of
which you are an ornament?"</p>

<p>"Jimmie, you shall not make fun of Donahue. I know
he's not pretty. But his eyes are kind, and he is good.
He is not for ornament," Augusta defended.</p>

<p>Jimmie laughed wickedly. "All the homely people I
ever knew have had that said about them. They are not
pretty, but their eyes are good, and they are useful. And
they <i>do</i> love to hear it! Yes! The men swear great deep
oaths under their breath. And what the women do I was
never able even to guess." And he shook his head in
utter inability to deal with the matter.</p>

<p>"But, pardon me, you are divinely right&mdash;as always&mdash;about
Donahue. Not only is he useful and good;
he is more. He is essential, and virtuous. I would
defend his morals in open court. And when I think of
his temptations, of the wild free and frisky gypsy life
that he has led, and then contemplate the shining
nobility of his stern virtues, I am positively ashamed of
myself. At such times I even resolve to lead a better
life.</p>

<p>"He is a thief, of course," he continued reflectively,
"but then, stealing is a gypsy virtue, so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He isn't any such thing," Augusta said, again
drawn out to the defense. "I know he ate the bag of
apples, bag and all. But he thought they were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Woman, you interrupt. You digress. You trifle.
You dissipate and confuse the issue. Let us get on. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
are not discussing Donahue. <i>He</i> is considering <i>us</i>. Does
he approve, or does he merely tolerate? That is the
point."</p>

<p>Augusta was at the instant fearfully engaged in the
perilous strategy of turning a good sized steak on a very
small pan, and was not paying the slightest attention
to what he said.</p>

<p>"Again I say, Donahue, let us have your decently
reserved opinion. I do not ask for brutal frankness. No
rough work, you understand. You have now, for the
afore-mentioned two thoughtful days, listened to my
uplifting conversation. You have been blessed with the
vision of Augusta's beauty. You have eaten her apples.
What then? It is time for you to speak."</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Donahue turned his head slightly and
sniffed delicately of the mingled tang of Augusta's wood
fire and the savor of the cooking steak. His head was
close to the ground. He wriggled one ear in a deliberate
and patent pretense that a fly was bothering him. Then,
as though realizing that that subterfuge would not
serve, he calmly and meditatively lifted his off fore leg
and deliberatively scratched the prominence back of his
ear, with the soft side of his hock.</p>

<p>"Aha! A diplomat! Did you see that, Augusta? He
has that rarest combination of all&mdash;outstanding virtue
coupled with tact and good manners. How many very
good people are there who could have refrained from
giving us their honest opinion? Their duty would have
forced them to it. But Donahue, no. He scratches his ear,
and refrains. How beautiful it is to be able to refrain!</p>

<p>"All right, Donahue. All in your own good time.
Either you do not care to hurt our feelings, or you are
not yet sure that you have made us out. Scratch on, oh
gentle minded philosopher, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jimmie, get the big plate. You might as well help as
sit on that rock and talk. He isn't listening anyway."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Leaving Donahue to his own thoughts, Jimmie went
obediently over to the wagon and stepping up on the
cross-bar reached a long arm in back of the seat to a
swinging rack and deftly brought forth a heavy platter.</p>

<p>"We'll dine out to-night," said Augusta, nodding at
the little folding table that she had set out on the grass.</p>

<p>"Oh hear ye, Donahue, our beloved Lady cracketh a
pun!"</p>

<p>"Don't jiggle the plate. And <i>don't drop</i> it!"</p>

<p>Craftily, his eye on the shifting level of the gravy,
his feet feeling for the uneven places of the ground,
Jimmie made his perilous journey, with the combined
manner of a sleep walker and of a priest of some terrible
temple of sacrifice, from the stove to the table.</p>

<p>Then, when Augusta had followed with other things,
they sat down on little camp stools close together. A
sudden timid, half-fearful reverence and diffidence
came over them, as of a perfect moment that could not
be held nor ever fully repeated. A fleeting, intangible
joy in each other caught them, joy in their very aloneness,
in their oneness of thought and heart and soul.
And they knew, almost fearfully, that such moments are
rare in even the very happiest of all lives. A little tear
glistened in the sunlight on Augusta's lashes.</p>

<p>But Jimmie knew better than to let the moment fade
out trying to prolong it. Better break it while the
beauty of it was yet in the glow.</p>

<p>"I am dying, Egypt, dying, for the half of that steak!
Is it any concern of yours, Madam, that your husband
has had no food for the last four and twenty
hours?"</p>

<p>"You've had six egg's and three quarts of milk, and
you fought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Food! I said. Didn't I, Donahue? I repeat, I've had
nothing to eat since this time last night. And I am
ravening. If you don't cut, I shall tear!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
"Hold the table steady, then."</p>

<p>They ate with happy hunger, laughing at the untried
makeshifts with which they tried to bridge over the
distance between sacred table manners and the bird-in-hand
necessities of the rickety little board, spatting a
little now and then as each insisted on giving the other
the choicest bits of the food.</p>

<p>Once Jimmie spilled over the salt in a moment of
forgetfulness, and he watched curiously as he saw
Augusta furtively pick up a tiny pinch of it and pretend
to look at it and then, just naturally, throw it over her
shoulder. Strangely enough, he had nothing to say on
the matter. This little girl woman of his made him
think a great deal.</p>

<p>Augusta had brought him home that other morning,
out of the park, and sent him to bed. Then she had gone
rapidly and ruthlessly to work as though she had been
planning just what she was to do.</p>

<p>She saw the boarders of the house at breakfast and
told them that she must close the house at once. Some
of them had been friends and it pained her to give
them any inconvenience. But she told them just why
she was forced to do what she was doing. And, before
she had finished, there was not one of them who would
not have agreed to move his or her trunk out to the
sidewalk on the instant, if it would help her.</p>

<p>Then she went to renting agents. And before another
day she had sublet the house for the remainder of the
term of her mother's lease.</p>

<p>The next part of her work was the worst. She had to
bring into the house dirty, pock-marked men whose
business it was to paw around with grimy hands and
shake the furniture and try to bluff her into discouragement.
But she had fixed upon a certain sum of cash
money that she must have from the sale of the furniture.
And from that determination she was not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
moved. One after another, Ann joyfully drove these
men from the house, and Augusta waited.</p>

<p>The dealers had, of course, run around and seen
each other and had agreed among themselves to force
her to sell for very little cash. Her husband was sick.
She had to go away with him. What could she do? It
did not so much matter, they told each other, which
of them got the furniture. That could be all fixed up.
The thing was to protect the business, so that people
shouldn't think that they ought to get new prices in
cash for old stuff.</p>

<p>But finally Augusta's steady insistence on one price
convinced one dealer that she would never sell for less.
He talked with her over the phone. Then he came
hurrying to the house, not because he wished to beat
his brothers with whom he had agreed, but because he
was afraid some one of them would beat him.</p>

<p>He offered Augusta half what she had demanded.
Augusta did not argue. She called Ann to do her duty.
The wordy battle raged down the stairs and out through
the front hall to the door. On the doorstep, with Ann
jamming the door on his foot where he had stuck it to
prevent her shutting the door, he came to within ten
dollars of the sum which Augusta had fixed. With
another bang at his foot, Ann relented and let him come
back to the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>Augusta was standing at the head of the stairs. She
did not feel any of the zest of battle which inspired Ann.
Jimmie was worse that day than she had dreamed of
his being. She was keeping him to his room and, as
far as possible, hiding from him the things that were
taking place in the house. She dreaded now to have
him hear any of this argument, and she was sickened
with the thought that the ten dollars over which they
were haggling might some day be just the price of
the difference between life and death for her Jimmie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Who could tell? The day might come when just for
that ten dollars he might be denied the some one thing
that would mean life for him. A wild, unknown anger
flamed up in her and she took a step down the stairs,
threatening in a tense, bitter voice:</p>

<p>"If you do not give me all, I will take everything
out into the street and burn it."</p>

<p>The man took one look up into her flaming eyes,
and&mdash;his hands dropped from the argument which
they had been preparing. He turned quickly, grabbed
a bill from his pocket and handed it over to Ann, to
bind the contract.</p>

<p>Augusta left the two of them to quarrel out the details,
for there were some things which she had stipulated
that Ann must have. For herself she had reserved
only some cooking things and plenty of blankets.</p>

<p>In the meantime she had accomplished the most
ambitious part of the whole enterprise. She had bought
a horse. She owned Donahue.</p>

<p>Back in her not distant school days Augusta had
known Mary Donahue. Old Greenwich village, which
nowadays harbors its thousands of intellectual gypsies
and free riders of every shade and hobby, used to, and
does still, furnish a winter home for a circle&mdash;they
were not a tribe&mdash;of Irish gypsies. They did not form
a community, nor did they travel the country in caravans.
Each family went out by itself in the spring,
through the northern part of the state, sold its own
laces, told its own fortunes, swapped its own horses.
But by what seemed an unspoken agreement they all
returned late in the fall to the same neighborhood.
With the instinct for places, which is strong in even
the most unreliable of migratory birds, they came to
refuge in the rickety jumbles of houses between Washington
Square and West Fourteenth street, where one
street blunders into another, and gets nowhere, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
turns back, until, in desperation, West Fourth street
crosses West Twelfth street and ties the whole business
up in a knot.</p>

<p>Patrick Sarsfield Donahue was one of these gypsies,
coming honestly and anciently into his way of living
and having no intention of leaving it for any other.
But Mary Donahue, his daughter, was untrue to the
traditions of her kind in that she had insisted on going
to school every day of the time they were in New York.
Augusta had been interested in her. Augusta <i>would</i> be.</p>

<p>Now Augusta went down across Fourteenth street
to find Mary Donahue. If Mary Donahue could, and
she did, manage, cook for, boss and generally hold
together on the road, an enterprise that consisted of a
father, six horses&mdash;more or less according to the balance
of trade, four growing sisters, two wagons, two small
healthy brothers, and uncounted, and wholly unaccountable,
dogs; if Mary Donahue could manage this,
and drive a team of horses, then Augusta could drive
one horse and keep Jimmie out in the air and free from
worry until he should be cured.</p>

<p>The idea was so simple and so much to her own liking
that Augusta was almost ashamed to think of the fun
she was going to have with it. And she hugged it
jealously to herself so that Jimmie should not know
until the wagon was at the door for him.</p>

<p>She knew how he would loathe and fret at the thought
of going to any sort of a sanitarium or a resort. And
she had a terrible dread that her money would not be
enough for that. Now this way, once the horse and
wagon were paid for, they would not need any money
except for the things they actually ate, they and the
horse. She was necessarily a little vague about the
latter item. But Mary Donahue could give her the
facts as an expert.</p>

<p>Mary Donahue, red haired, quick, a woman where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Augusta was a child, understood and glowed with
sympathy. But she could not entirely suppress the
little smile of the professional at the ardent amateur.
Mentally she gave them about three days to stay out
on the road.</p>

<p>But then Augusta talked to her. And Mary Donahue
came and saw the business-like way in which
Augusta had dismantled the house. And she saw
Jimmie. And Augusta talked to her more.</p>

<p>The result was that Patrick Donahue sold Augusta a
gypsy horse and a gypsy wagon. And Mary Donahue
drove the spectacle to Augusta's door one morning
early and announced that she herself would pilot the
expedition out of the perils of New York.</p>

<p>She drove the length of Broadway, until that
thoroughfare became a country road well beyond the
sacred, constable haunted terraces of Yonkers. All the
while she discoursed valuable information and wise
counsel. Augusta listened greedily, cramming mental
notes until her head swam. Wardwell listened too, half
asleep, lying most of the day in a bunk that stretched
along the side of the wagon, not really believing that
this thing was going on as it seemed to be, but not
interested enough, and really too sick, to bother about
a protest.</p>

<p>Before sun-down Mary Donahue helped them with
their first camping and cooking. And Augusta, meekly
submitting to the rulings of her mentor, was filled
with the secret inner triumph of the dreamer who sees
his dream come true under the last commonplace test
of practicability. She could do it! Her plan would
work!</p>

<p>Wardwell, standing around, easing the soreness out
of his joints, and sniffing with water in his mouth at
the cooking meat&mdash;. He had at this time an almost
animal craving for red meat, and Augusta's diet would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
not allow it until night&mdash;Wardwell, too, knew with a
sudden conviction that Augusta's plan was going to
work.</p>

<p>By the time the busy gypsy girl had shown how to
stow the things away for the night she had become so
interested in the project that she began to feel a certain
responsibility for it.</p>

<p>"What would you do," she asked, eyeing Augusta
speculatively as the latter sat on a low stump with a
red framing of low sumach bushes hanging about her
shoulders, "what could you do if you lost your money
on the road, or went broke, or&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but," Augusta broke in quickly, "Jimmie's
going to be all right in no time. And he'll be writing
lots and lots. And since it won't cost us hardly anything
to live, why we'll be getting rich&mdash;rich!"</p>

<p>She did not want the financial outcome of their
venture discussed in Jimmie's hearing. She herself
had no more thought or fear of the future than have
the birds when they start to follow the spring into the
north. But she knew that Jimmie's mind was raw on
just this, and she wanted it plain that he was the man
and the provider.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mary Donahue, not listening.
"But&mdash;with eyes like yours"&mdash;she was studying Augusta
out loud&mdash;"and with the look that comes in
them at times&mdash;why, it'd be a shame not to&mdash;" She
wheeled quickly and jumped up into the wagon.</p>

<p>She came back with a bundle which she dropped on
Augusta's lap. Out of it she shook a long flaming red
veil which she wound quickly and bewilderingly around
Augusta's head and shoulders.</p>

<p>Wardwell looked on, a benign and philosophical
spectator. It seemed that the gypsy girl had packed the
wagon. Jimmie was wondering mildly if she had, perhaps,
packed in a witch's cauldron, and a package or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
two of forked lightning, and a few snail's teeth. If so,
he would look forward to an interesting summer.</p>

<p>"Your hair's all wrong for a fortune teller, of course,"
Mary Donahue admitted. "But that don't make any
difference&mdash;mine's worse, and I can make as much as
the best of them. If it does you no good, it'll do you
no harm," she grumbled as she felt Augusta's rising
resistance.</p>

<p>"You don't have to keep the money, you know. But
always make them pay some money, anyway. Do you
hear? Never tell a fortune without money to pay."</p>

<p>She gave Augusta no time to answer but dove at
the bundle again, unfolding a red board and breaking
out on it a pack of cards.</p>

<p>"You are a 'heart' woman," she said, continuing
aloud her study of Augusta. "You are almost too light
now, but you'll get darker, and you're married; that
makes a difference."</p>

<p>She laid the cards at Augusta's hand, commanding:</p>

<p>"With your left hand, cut three piles towards your
heart."</p>

<p>Augusta gingerly lifted the cards as she was told.
She was just a little frightened, but she would not
protest or let Jimmie see that she felt it to be anything
more than a joke.</p>

<p>The gypsy gravely inspected the cards, top and
bottom, of the three piles, and said nothing. Then she
put them together and began dealing out from top and
bottom into eight piles, a single card to each pile as she
went.</p>

<p>"To your house"&mdash;she named the piles as she laid
down each card&mdash;"to yourself&mdash;to the one you love
best&mdash;what you do expect&mdash;what you do not expect&mdash;sure
to come true&mdash;this night&mdash;your wish."</p>

<p>When she had dealt out all the cards in this way, she
turned up the first pile and began to read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
"<i>To your house</i>: there is love and good times, lots of
fun making. You'll both still be laughing and taking
fun out of it no matter what comes. It is all good,
good!" She was kneeling at Augusta's side now. There
was none of the air of mystery of the professional card
reader. She had forgotten that she was giving Augusta a
lesson. She was poring eagerly over the cards reading
them swiftly as they came up to her, with all of a child's
abandon in a game.</p>

<p>"<i>To yourself</i>: there is shortness of money. You will be
worried about money, not right away, maybe, but some
time before very long. And a horse, a horse will be in a
part of the worry.</p>

<p>"<i>To the one you love best</i>: a dark&mdash;!" She stopped and
turned about with a swift, tigerish twist of her lithe
body. Wardwell, who had been gangling about, amused,
and yet feeling somewhat left out of the picture, suddenly
found himself pierced by the angriest pair of blue
eyes he had ever seen. He did not know what it was
about. But from the look the girl gave him he would not
have been surprised if she had leapt upon him and
buried claws in him.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what is it?" Augusta asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the gypsy girl shortly. And she
turned back to the cards.</p>

<p>"<i>What you do expect</i>: there is sickness and long
journeying, and black and white all mixed together.</p>

<p>"<i>What you do not expect</i>: deceit. Deceit will break
your life." Again the girl turned sharply to eye Wardwell.
Evidently he stood the scrutiny well, for she
turned back and said quite gently:</p>

<p>"I mustn't do this. You didn't ask me. And you
didn't pay me. And I'm only giving you a lesson, anyway.
Now just watch and listen." She mixed the cards
all up together and began pulling out combinations at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
random, reading them in hasty rhymes as she showed
them to Augusta.</p>

<p>"Back to back says speedy meeting&mdash;Three eights,
change of states&mdash;Two jacks and a king, a constable
bring&mdash;Two kings and a jack, an old friend back&mdash;"
And so on through twenty flying combinations, while
Augusta watched the quick brown fingers and listened
to the broken rhyming, fascinated, yet feeling that she
would very much rather not touch the cards at all. She
knew, of course, that she would never think of using
them in the way the gypsy girl had suggested. Nevertheless,
she was afraid of them. She was sharply conscious
that the girl had stopped telling what she saw in the
reading because she had thought that she saw something
unpleasant, and something connected with
Jimmie.</p>

<p>Augusta knew that she could never believe in any of
this. It was just the patter of a trade. The combinations
suggested the rhymes that went with them. That was
all. But, just the same, and although she was very
grateful for the help that the girl had given her, Augusta
was wishing that Mary Donahue would take her
cards and go home.</p>

<p>"Now shuffle the cards and see it for yourself," Mary
Donahue wheedled. "You've got it in you&mdash;I can see
it in your eyes. And when you have that, you can see
things even if you don't know the names of the cards.
And if you haven't got it, you could study them all
your life&mdash;I've known people that did&mdash;and never know
boo."</p>

<p>Augusta took the cards with evident reluctance, but
began to shuffle them with an ease and sureness that
caught Wardwell's attention instantly. He remembered
that Rose Wilding had had an unexplained horror of
cards. She had never permitted even the most innocent
game of cards in her house. It had been a difficult and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
at times, an irksome restriction. He knew that more than
once she had lost good boarders on account of it. But
Rose Wilding had persisted in her strong way, with
few words, giving neither excuse nor explanation. So
he was fairly certain that Augusta had never before
held in her hands a pack of cards.</p>

<p>Now he watched with sharp interest Augusta's deft,
natural handling of the cards, and, somehow, he did not
like it.</p>

<p>With a feeling of growing excitement Augusta laid
out the piles as she had seen the other girl do, and without
wishing to do so found herself naming over the
piles as she went around. She had not thought that she
would remember how they ran. But she found that she
could not forget if she tried. And it seemed that she
did not want to try.</p>

<p>Augusta turned up the first of the piles and looked
blankly at them. Her hands were cool and firm, but she
felt herself trembling inwardly with a queer, creeping
surge of blood. And she drew a quick breath of relief
when she saw that the cards meant nothing to her.
They were just a jumble of red and black and white,
just pictures and spots. She wondered at herself for
being excited about it.</p>

<p>"Don't try to read anything from them," the gypsy
voice at her ear commanded. "Just don't think of anything,
and just keep staring steady and steady until
your eyes cross."</p>

<p>Wardwell, watching, felt an irritated impulse to
interfere. He hated to see Augusta's delicately sensitized
mind submitted to these gypsy tricks. But,
man-like, he was afraid of appearing ridiculous if he
made any kind of a fuss. For, after all, it was only a
little bit of fooling.</p>

<p>Augusta sat limp and stared indifferently down at the
cards as she had been told to do. Her eyes fell out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
focus and she continued to stare while the spots and
pictures moved about in a soothing, restful sort of blur
that lured her mind farther and farther away from the
grip of conscious thought.</p>

<p>Without any wish to do so, and without any thought,
she began to speak.</p>

<p>"<i>To my house</i>: there is laughter and fear, coming
together and in pairs. I must never, never share my
house with any third one. There is water laughing by
it all the day long in the sunshine, and a bleak wind
whistling past in the night.</p>

<p>"<i>To myself</i>: I am starting upon a long, long journey.
I shall not rest and my feet will be hurrying always,
always. For the end of my journey is hidden in the
heart of The Hills of Desire.</p>

<p>"<i>To the one I love best</i>: there is a dark woman, tall
and straight, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>A quick, visible tremor ran over her, and as though it
had touched a spring in her body she sprang into the
air like a wounded animal. As she came to her feet,
groping and tottering, her head cleared and she saw
Wardwell and ran to him.</p>

<p>"What was it, dear?" he said soothingly, petting her
head as she hid her face against his breast. "Don't
think of it, darling. We both know that it's nothing but
nonsense. We won't tell our fortunes, sweetheart. We'll
just live them."</p>

<p>Augusta did not say anything. But after a little,
feeling the security of Jimmie's arms about her, she
turned and looked defiantly, resentfully at Mary
Donahue who was unconcernedly picking up the
cards and the board from the ground where Augusta's
sudden move had scattered them. Then Augusta was
aware of the gypsy veil about her head. She tore it off
and threw it at the stooping girl.</p>

<p>She was instantly sorry and apologetic. She ran over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and picking it up she handed it to Mary Donahue,
who had pretended, very plausibly, not to notice.</p>

<p>Mary Donahue took it and wrapped up the bundle
as she had brought it from the wagon. Then she went
to put the bundle back where it belonged, at the same
time announcing that she must be getting home.</p>

<p>With a final admonition to them not to poke holes in
the roof of the wagon, she shook hands with Wardwell,
kissed Augusta, and stepped away across the fields
toward a trolley line that would take her to New
York.</p>

<p>They never saw her again.</p>

<p>In the morning Jimmie saw Augusta struggling with
the harness which Mary Donahue had so easily slung
under the wagon. He was minded to let her wrestle with
it for a while. For, with a sick man's querulousness he
was sometimes irritated by the ease and capability with
which Augusta got things done. It was a constant
challenge to his own frequent periods of helplessness.
But he could not be unkind. He came dutifully over to
help her.</p>

<p>"We'll have to do this thing in the orthodox way,
Augusta, or that horse will laugh himself to death at
us."</p>

<p>"I know what goes on first," Augusta defended herself
against his implications. "But I don't know the
name of it."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Jimmie. "Go over and get the
horse by the mane. Talk to him. Divert his attention.
I'm nervous while he watches me fooling about with his
necktie and suspenders. What the deuce is his name,
anyhow? In another minute I'll be calling him 'it,' like a
baby."</p>

<p>"Why, Jimmie, I forgot to ask!" Augusta confessed
blankly, feeling herself convicted of a serious neglect.
"Whatever shall we do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
"Christen him."</p>

<p>"But what good will that do? He won't know that it's
his name."</p>

<p>"Tell him."</p>

<p>"But, how?"</p>

<p>"How did he find out his name in the first place?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;Oh yes," Augusta brightened, "You
just shake the oats at him, or whatever it is for little
horses, and you say Dan, Dan, or whatever it is. And
that's his name!"</p>

<p>"But suppose it was Alice? Nonsense!" Jimmie
argued contrarily. "He'd think it was the name of the
oats. Just as if you said Bran, Bran! or Force, Force! or
Shredded&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now Jimmie, please stop. And be serious and think.
You <i>know</i> we've got to call him <i>something</i>. Why just
think! If anyone should stop us and ask us what was our
horse's name. And we'd have to say that we didn't
know. And then they'd tell somebody else. And somebody
else would stop us and ask us. And then we'd be
stopped and suspected and arrested and maybe put in a
jail somewhere."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> wouldn't," said Jimmie basely. "<i>I</i> didn't steal the
horse."</p>

<p>He stooped quickly as though he expected something
to be thrown at his head. But as his eye caught something
on the collar he straightened up exultantly.</p>

<p>"It's all right!" he exclaimed eagerly. "We're safe!
Here's his name on the collar."</p>

<p>"Oh, on his collar! I didn't know they did that for
horses. Let me see."</p>

<p>"There it is, plain as his nose."</p>

<p>"Donahue," Augusta read. "But that isn't <i>his</i> name.
That's his father's name&mdash;I mean, Mary's father's
name&mdash;I mean, his owner's name."</p>

<p>"No," said Jimmie gravely. "I'm afraid you don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
understand at all. You see, gypsies are that way. The
oldest horse&mdash;You will admit that this is the oldest
horse&mdash;the oldest horse is always called by the family
name. You understand, it's just like in England. You
know they never think of calling the son and heir by
any boy's name. He is not Billie or Teddy or anything
like that. He's simply called by the name of the
house. He's Kingsmead, or Duncastle, or Ravenwood&mdash;So
strong, you know, and effective."</p>

<p>"So," he waved his hand by way of introduction,
"we have with us, 'Donahue.'"</p>

<p>Augusta crinkled up her little nose. She knew that
Jimmie was quite capable of cooking up the whole
explanation on the instant. But, as she had no way of
convicting him just now, she accepted the introduction
and called out sweetly to the horse who was grazing
unconcernedly at the end of his tie-rope:</p>

<p>"Donahue!"</p>

<p>He lifted his head. So it was settled. His name was
Donahue.</p>

<p>Jimmie glowed with virtuous triumph as he led
"Donahue" over to the wagon, slung on the harness
and backed him between the shafts.</p>

<p>But as Augusta finally climbed into the wagon she
noticed a name painted on the front boxing under their
seat. While Jimmie went through the wholly superlative
business of guiding Donahue out to the open road&mdash;the
horse would have done much better if let have his own
head&mdash;Augusta wriggled skilfully back into the body
of the wagon, to search for further proofs of Jimmie's
duplicity. Evidently she found plenty of them, for
when she got back into her place her face was red with
exertion and suppressed anger. Jimmie gave his entire
attention to the road ahead, driving ostentatiously with
both hands as though he were in the finish of a crowded
race&mdash;Donahue would not have left his sober, middle-of-the-road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
walk for anything less than a roaring motor
truck.</p>

<p>Augusta broke out laughing hysterically. Jimmie
preserved a dignified, inquiring silence, while Donahue
almost broke into a trot.</p>

<p>"The wagon's name is Donahue!" Augusta wailed
shrilly between peals of laughter. "Just like the first
son in England! And the cook stove is named Donahue.
And they call the skillet Donahue. And the name of
your bunk is Donahue!"</p>

<p>"'Bunk?'" Jimmie queried dejectedly. "Was it all
bunk? It sounded all right while I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't mean slang. I mean the thing you slept on."</p>

<p>"I didn't sleep," said Jimmie, springing nimbly to a
diversion of the attack. "I only touched the thing in three
spots. And I've got corns in all three places."</p>

<p>"Well, you snored," said Augusta cruelly.</p>

<p>"Never!" Jimmie averred with solemn unction.
"I never snore."</p>

<p>"Very good," Augusta agreed pleasantly. "I suppose
you'll say it was Donahue."</p>

<p>"This comes of being married," Jimmie remarked
warningly to the Hudson river. "Never before did any
lady tell me to my blushing face that I snored like a
horse."</p>

<p>So they bickered happily through the June morning,
careless of where the end of the road might be, the feeling
of dependence upon each other and of utter independence
of all other things wrapping them together
in a nearness that was so sweet and so friendly tender
that it almost hurt.</p>

<p>And here at the end of their beautiful first day alone
Wardwell sat watching his little lady furtively toss a
pinch of the spilled salt over her shoulder. He knew the
superstition about spilled salt. Augusta was taking no
chances. But he was wondering&mdash;as he probably would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
continue to wonder during the length of his life&mdash;at how
little he knew of the real thoughts that went on back
of the beautiful blue eyes that looked out so open and
unafraid at him and at all the world.</p>

<p>Was she a child that had not learned to know fear?
Or was she a woman full grown, so wise in love and
strength that she could look down all fear? He guessed
that she was both of these things. For she threw salt
over her shoulder. And she looked out of those deep
blue eyes into the blood-red sunset on the opposite hills
across the wide river, and he saw that there was in those
eyes a light as brave and unafraid as fire itself. The light
is never afraid of the darkness, for while the light lives
there is no dark.</p>

<p>The day had been quite unseasonably hot and there
were storm clouds piling up like boulders on the tops of
the lower Catskills, away to the northwest. The river
lay below them, dry-eyed, still, mistless, with a great,
terrifying gash of red shot across its bosom where lay
the path to the dying sun.</p>

<p>A breathless, heavy hush lay over the valley. Shutting
their eyes to the motion of the distant boats, they could
have believed that the world had suddenly died around
them, leaving them alone and forgotten. There was not a
sound, not a ripple of air, not even the whirring of a
bat or the cheep of a bird. Wardwell, over sensitive and
craving for the homely cheery noises of things moving,
stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>But Augusta, child though she was of shut in city
walls, had in her enough of the primitive to know that
there was a physical cause for the hush that had fallen
upon nature. She could feel a storm coming.</p>

<p>How would Jimmie stand it? She had thought of this
when she was planning&mdash;if indeed she had really done
any planning&mdash;to make this adventure. But it was a
fact that she had thought only vaguely of warm rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
beating harmlessly against the tight roof of the wagon,
of falling dreamily off to sleep in the dark listening to
the soft patter and drip of rain among the trees.</p>

<p>Now she looked fearfully at Jimmie, and at the frail
walls of their home. And she trembled as she thought of
the security and comfort from which she had brought
him to this, where she had but a bit of dripping canvas
to put between him and exposure. Already in the
process of mothering him she had come to think of
him as a helpless child. And vague, terrifying memories
played upon her, of things heard and imagined, of great
trees crashing down in forests, of roaring winds and
furious, driving rain beating down to death the little
wild things of the woods. Now she realized, for the
first time it seemed, that Jimmie's life hung perilously
on the care that she could give him, that even a wetting,
such as, for herself, she could laugh at, would perhaps
cost him more than he could gain by days and days in
the open.</p>

<p>With a determined shrug she threw off the impression
and rising began to rattle the dishes.</p>

<p>"Jimmie," she said lightly "take the pail from under
the wagon and go out to the spring for water. I've let
the fire die down and now I'll have to build it up again,
for nothing but boiling water will take the fat off these
dishes."</p>

<p>"You should have camped near a hot water spring."</p>

<p>"There isn't any such thing."</p>

<p>"Sure there is; there's Arkansas Hot Springs&mdash;Why
didn't you camp there?&mdash;And Virginia Hot Spring, and
San Antone, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take Donahue with you, if you must talk. He'll
listen, if you give him a drink."</p>

<p>"Donahue," he said sadly as he unhooked the pail
from under the wagon, "we be brothers in calumny.
She blackens your character. She belittles my powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of charming converse. Let us retire to the unfrequented
spring and there we shall mingle our bitter tears with
the sweet waters."</p>

<p>Donahue saw the pail being taken from its place,
knew that the pail was going where there was water,
and followed without comment.</p>

<p>Mary Donahue had indicated for Augusta the spring
and the camping place. A high wall of hill stood up
above the road on the right and out of the hill came the
spring. On the river side of the road a fringe of trees
screened the little flat promontory in the centre of
which the wagon stood. Occasionally the purring of a
swiftly driven automobile on the hard road within a few
yards of them told them that the world still ran its
hustling way, but they were as effectually hidden and
private as if they had been securely housed in the middle
of some vast estate of their own. And when the dishes
were washed and everything put in shape for the night,
Augusta brought blankets and they sat perched out
on the very edge of the cliff looking down to where the
"Central" trains thundered along some two hundred
feet directly below them, and out across the broad, dark
expanse of the river.</p>

<p>The Albany boat came gliding up the silent path of
the river, her tiered, warmly lighted decks looking like a
series of summer porches, the steady, even motion of
the boat giving to the watchers on the hill the pleasant
feeling that she was standing and that they were being
gently carried past her.</p>

<p>The searchlight from the boat playing along the hill
bank caught the figures of the boy and girl struck out
in enormous silhouettes above the rim of the cliff and a
merry cheer came up from the boat.</p>

<p>"Go on and mind your own business," scolded Jimmie.
"We are no mooning young couple. And we are no
subject for flash-light pictures. We are sober married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
folks, with our home in the background and a respectable
horse in the middle distance."</p>

<p>The flashlight held them for a moment and then
swung off overhead and went to peer into the windows
of a moving train on the "West Shore." The band on
the now receding boat broke into an old fashioned waltz
tune which, sweetened and mellowed by the distance
and the echoing chording of the hills, came up to them
with the softness of a gentle, kindly dream of forgotten
people.</p>

<p>The breaking contour of the river soon hid the lights
of the boat, and Jimmie and Augusta were left to the
great, solemn thinking silences about them, and to
themselves, very content.</p>

<p>In the stark blackness of the closed wagon, in the
middle of the night, Augusta found herself standing on
the floor. She did not know how, or why, she had
gotten out of the little string hammock that was her
bed. But now she was shocked into full wakefulness.
The wagon seemed to be moving and she gave a little
scream of terror as she thought of the cliff and the
terrible broken fall to the tracks below.</p>

<p>But the roar of the wind and swish of driven rain
drowned her scream and she realized that what she
thought was movement was just the swaying of the
wagon body on its springs.</p>

<p>Reassured, and recovering quickly from her first
fright, she stood swaying in the middle of the floor, her
hand clutching the wooden side of Jimmie's bunk. He
was sleeping quietly, very quietly it seemed, and
Augusta had to lean her ear down almost to his lips to
catch the stir of his breathing.</p>

<p>The chill of the water laden air caught her lightly
clad body and she shivered as her hands went groping
over Jimmie's bedding to see that he was all covered and
dry. The tugging of the wind at the canvas threatened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
her now, not with the fear that it might overturn the
wagon or drive it over the cliff but that it might rip a
hole somewhere and drench Jimmie.</p>

<p>Again she thought with trembling of the safe refuge
of solid walls, of the friendly comfort of feeling that
people were near at hand to help if there were need,
and a wave of homesick loneliness, a sickening fear of
destitution and homelessness, swept over her.</p>

<p>The storm driving high across the chasm of the river
struck full and mercilessly at the wagon exposed on the
tip of the cliff. Sheets of rain came whipping down the
wind, tearing at the canvas and threatening every
instant to strip it from the frames. The wind went
snapping and howling by like some hungry, angry
animal, defeated and driven off for the moment, but
sure to come and threaten again. Peals of thunder rolled
and reverberated against the rocks, coming every
moment nearer and more terrifying as the centre of the
storm swept down the river. Augusta straightened up
and stood there, it seemed for hours, her eyes staring
wide and fascinated, waiting for and cringing under each
successive stroke of lighting as it came ripping down
through the storm, lighting the black interior of the
wagon with a ghastly glow. At last, when it seemed that
if she faced another flash of the horrid light she must
surely go mad, she sank down to her knees upon the
cold floor and buried her eyes deep in the pillow beside
Jimmie's head. She wanted to wake him, to creep into
his arms and be held, for she was horribly frightened.
But he was warm and safe as he was and she felt that
she must not disturb him.</p>

<p>After a little she remembered that she must not do
things like this. She must be sensible and get back into
the warmth of her blankets. She was shivering and
chattering with cold and fright. And she knew that she
must take no risks of making herself ill. She rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
obediently to the telling of her own good sense and went
groping for her hammock. But she felt that she must
look outside. If she could only once see the solid world
outside and know with her eyes that it was standing
still and unmoved while her own crazy shelter rocked
and swayed she could feel safer.</p>

<p>She poked a little hole between the curtains at the
back of the wagon, for the wind was driving dead at the
front, and peeped out. A flash of lightning showed her
Donahue, the mis-named, the sturdy, the patient,
standing unmoved and uncomplaining in the lee of the
wagon. Her heart gave a bound of pity and compunction.
She had forgotten him entirely. She had not even
thought of his being out there in the storm. He might
have walked away, she thought, and found some shed
or shelter for himself. Instead, he stood there, dumb and
faithful. Impulsively she put her hand out into the rain
towards him, and she was thrilled with a sudden feeling
of comfort and help as she felt a cold wet nose come up
and nuzzle in her palm.</p>

<p>She did not know that the love which came to her in
that moment for the big, ungainly, faithful horse would
one day spring the trap of life for her and Jimmie. But
even if she had known, I think she would still have
preferred to love him.</p>

<p>She crept contentedly back into bed. And although
the wind howled and the rain lashed mercilessly and she
watched nervously all through the night, yet she had
none of the panic fear of her early fright. That figure of
patient, dumb strength and dependableness standing
out there in the storm had given her a courage that
would not be easily shaken again.</p>

<p>Towards morning the wind went down, but the rain
continued to fall in a steady drizzling mist that ushered
in a gray, cold, depressing morning. To Augusta it
seemed interminable hours before it was time to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
up and feed Donahue. She thought seriously of making
hot coffee for him, but gave up the idea, not because
she was afraid of Jimmie's ridicule but because she was
not sure that Donahue would understand.</p>

<p>Jimmie slept heavily and awoke feverish and coughing
horribly. Augusta could think of nothing to do but
to get away from this place. It would have seemed more
reasonable to stay quiet at least until the rain stopped,
for here standing still she could keep the wagon tight
and dry inside. But she could not help feeling that they
would be better anywhere than here. Besides, the
commissariat was in trouble. When she opened the
little chest in the side of the wagon she found that the
four bottles of milk which she had bought the evening
before for Jimmie's ration of today had all been curdled
by the storm. That settled the matter. Jimmie could
not have his breakfast until she had found a farmhouse
or a country store where she could buy milk.
They must move on in the rain.</p>

<p>She bundled out cheerily in rain coat and rubbers to
assay the doubtful business of hitching the horse alone,
for she would not think of letting Jimmie out in the rain.</p>

<p>"I suppose, Donahue," she apologized, "it isn't
proper for a gypsy to wear rubbers. Probably I ought to
go barefoot, but you won't please expect that, for a little
while anyway. Now I hate to hurry your breakfast,"
she explained as she brought the bridle, "but you know
Jimmie hasn't had any yet, and doesn't know where
he's going to get any. And I strongly suspect that
you're only pretending anyhow. I'm almost sure," she
said peering sharply down into the bucket where
Donahue was making a hurried business of snuffing up
imaginary oats, "that you finished the last of your
oats five minutes ago. Hold up your head, sir."</p>

<p>Donahue did not understand the spoken word. Mary
Donahue had a way of slapping him sharply under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
jaw at this juncture. But out of the corner of his eye he
saw the bridle and raised his head cheerfully.</p>

<p>The harness was mean and sticky with the rain and
the mildew of the night's dampness, and Jimmie had
been none to expert in hanging it away so that it would
come out right and convenient. But with much tugging
and careful study and brave whistling in the rain, and
more tugging, Donahue was finally backed into the
shafts and the traces made fast. When all was ready and
Augusta was about to climb into the wagon she noticed
what seemed to be some entirely superfluous straps
hanging down towards Donahue's hind feet.</p>

<p>They were, of course, the "hold-back" straps, to
keep the wagon from bumping the horse's legs going
down hill. Augusta could see no earthly use for them,
but she knew they were out of place dangling down
there. They gave Donahue a half dressed effect which
she did not like. She wondered if she ought to consult
Jimmie, but after more study she remembered triumphantly
that they went around the shafts. She wound
them around the shafts and buckled them up neatly.
Knowing nothing of their importance or their purpose,
she could not know that the proper fastening home of a
hold-back strap to the shaft is a thing that must be
learned, and learned young. Everything now looked
right and neat, so she climbed up and fixed the driving
curtain as Mary Donahue had shown her how
to do.</p>

<p>"Do you think you'd better start," Jimmie objected
through the inner curtain at the last minute. "I'd
rather go hungry all day than to see you out there in the
rain. I'm not hungry anyway."</p>

<p>"Why, who cares for a little rain. Giddap, Donahue,"
she sang out tightening up the reins.</p>

<p>Donahue picked his way soberly out through the
trees and in spite of Augusta's tugging on the left hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
rein to turn him up the road deliberately crossed to the
spring.</p>

<p>"I didn't think you'd ever want water again,"
Augusta explained her oversight, "after last night."</p>

<p>Donahue took his accustomed morning draught, and,
blowing the water from his nostrils, turned sedately and
started up the road.</p>

<p>Jimmie sat upon his bunk, fully dressed, shivering
miserably and trying to choke down the sound of his
coughing. The wagon swayed along creaking and complaining
as they climbed the grade. He rose to look out
through the rear curtain at the gray, sodden day. He
wished that Augusta could not hear his cough. He knew
that it hurt her really more than it did him. And he
wished, he wished, well&mdash;several things. As he stood
there, thinking vaguely, dejectedly, he felt the wagon
slip forward gently, and then there was a slight bump.</p>

<p>The wagon was yanked forward so roughly that he
nearly fell out through the curtain. He caught himself
and swaying back was pitched into his bunk. He
scrambled up again and clutching desperately at the
side of his bunk managed to get forward to the back of
the driving seat. Tearing apart the curtain he tumbled
into the seat and understood what was happening.</p>

<p>The hold-back straps had slipped loose, the wagon
was bumping cruelly on Donahue's legs at every jump,
and he was running away madly down a long hill.</p>

<p>The driving curtain had broken down in front of
Augusta. She was down on her knees in the wet, her
hair flying wildly about her, tugging despairingly at
the reins over the dashboard, and praying:</p>

<p>"Oh, please, please, Donahue! What is it? What is
it? Please, whoa. I don't care, but you'll hurt Jimmie
Oh, please stop and don't hurt Jimmie!"</p>

<p>Then she turned to another quarter:</p>

<p>"Dear, dear God, and Mary Mother, please don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
let Jimmie get hurt. It's my fault! You know I took
him out this way. You know he didn't want to come,"
she appealed. "And I'll be so good. Oh, please don't
let Jimmie be hurt!"</p>

<p>Wardwell slipped cautiously down and gathering her
up braced her in the seat.</p>

<p>"Hold tight, dear," he commanded. "We'll be all
right." And he braced himself to saw on the reins.</p>

<p>But Donahue by this time had the bit in his teeth,
and so far as any effect of the reins was concerned
Jimmie might as well have been pulling at the dashboard.
The horse had no check rein. His head was down,
his back flattened out, and he was running like a
frightened dog, the wagon jolting down wickedly on his
legs at every few jumps.</p>

<p>Jimmie knew that he was as frightened and as powerless
as the girl crouching beside him. If he jumped with
her, they would be hurt or killed. If they stayed and
hung on the horse would surely stumble or the wagon
would slew off the road&mdash;he looked down the winding
stretch of the road and counted the curves and wondered
at which one of them they would be thrown over
the bank&mdash;or they would meet some heavy truck and
be crushed.</p>

<p>The crazed fright of the horse came back to the
hearts of the two behind him. The mad Rap-a-rap,
Rap-a-rap of his frantic feet on the hard road, the wild
careening of the wagon, the loud pumping of blood in
their throats took from them all sense and thought as
the rain beat unfelt upon their faces and trees and
rocks and fences whirled drunkenly by.</p>

<p>Augusta was hugging closely now while Jimmie
sawed mechanically at the reins, and he heard her praying
quietly. His heart stopped beating as he looked
down a sudden dip of the road below them and saw a
country railroad crossing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Beyond the tracks the road ran up a hill again. If he
could only cross safely, he could stop the horse there
where the incline of the hill would hold the wagon back
from hitting him.</p>

<p>But because this was all an ordered nightmare, Wardwell
heard, just where in a nightmare he would expect
to hear it, the whistle of a train. He tried to drag the
powerful crazed horse to the side of the road, to overturn
the wagon if he must. But he might as well have
tried to turn the oncoming engine.</p>

<p>Augusta saw the train coming toward the crossing, as
they were coming. She did not cry out, only snuggled a
little closer and waited. Then with one last mad dip
the horse struck the tracks, and the wagon leaped
across in front of the grinding engine.</p>

<p>A gray faced man leaning out of the cab of the engine
yelled crazily at them, but they did not hear. Donahue
ran on up the hill, until he seemed to miss something.
The wagon was not hitting him any more. Then he
became conscious of the tugging at his jaw. He slowed
down to a weak-kneed stumbling trot, then to a walk,
and stopped, shaking and panting.</p>

<p>Wardwell sat a while holding Augusta tight, for now
she was crying bitterly in great gasping sobs.</p>

<p>When he had petted and quieted her back to something
like herself, he started to get down to fix the hold-backs.
He was shaking weakly himself and as he reached
his foot down to the step his hand caught something for
support. It was the handle of the brake.</p>

<p>He stumbled to his feet on the ground, and turning
back, his hand still on the handle of the brake, he broke
out into a hysterical laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh Jimmie, don't!" said Augusta, frightened anew.</p>

<p>"Augusta," he said solemnly, "don't ever marry a
fool again."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what&mdash;?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
"This," he explained, "is a brake, to stop the wagon.
If I hadn't been a fool and lost my head I'd have
thought of that brake and stopped us right at the start.</p>

<p>"But, anyhow, I think this is enough. We had better
go back to the city, where people are paid to take care of
us."</p>

<p>Augusta sat a little while thinking, while Jimmie
fixed the hold-backs.</p>

<p>"Jimmie," she said simply, "do you think we'll ever
go through anything worse than that?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear, we will not."</p>

<p>"Then we've passed the worst, already," she announced
calmly. "Let us go and find your breakfast."</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<p>In the pearl dawn of a lovely July morning Augusta
lay in her hammock, happily lazy and wide awake
looking up at the line of the hills, watching the rosy
light from the sun as it flushed color up into the pale
eastern sky. Were these the hills of desire, she wondered,
thinking vaguely of the words that had come to
her while she studied the cards at the gypsy girl's
bidding. The long, sun-drenched, dusty days upon the
road, the sudden violent storms, the meetings with
people who thought her so queer a gypsy, all had swept
into a distant past the impression of that evening a
month ago. A happy, busy month it had been, full of
new things to be learned, of old, half forgotten things
to be remembered, of careful explanations to people
who did not listen; and three black, fearful days when
Jimmie had been so bad that they could not move, days
and especially nights when she had sat crouching beside
him and had felt her faith and her dear high hope slipping
from her and had frankly feared that he was dying.</p>

<p>Those nights of sinking fear seemed very far off this
morning as she lay and looked at Jimmie stretched out
along the length of the wagon on the other side, sleeping
as smoothly and easily as a child. She could see that the
skin still stretched drum tight over his temple hollows
and she knew that there were still hollows under his
big bony shoulders into which her two hands would
fit. But she no longer feared these things, for she could
see the vital tan of sun and wind creeping up across his
face and driving away the hated pallor and she knew
that this was the sign of life for him.</p>

<p>She smiled as she thought of the efforts she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
wasted in trying to tell people the truth of why they
were on the road in this way. She loved the freedom of
the road, but she did not want to be taken too literally
for a gypsy. So she was careful to explain to the farmer's
wives to whom she went to buy eggs and milk and in the
little village stores where she stopped for meat and
bread that she had nothing to trade in the gypsy way,
that she was just like anybody's wife travelling in this
way for her husband's health. They believed her&mdash;everybody
always believed Augusta on sight. But on
returning to the wagon it was often to find Jimmie
eloquently discoursing from the step of the wagon to
a moderate sized crowd of people&mdash;Where <i>did</i> they come
from? She would wonder horrified&mdash;upon the universal
merits of a certain gypsy remedy which had come down
to him through a wonderful and ever varying procession
of lineal antecedents, and which he was presently going
to bestow, at a nominal price, upon this distinguished
and intelligent audience.</p>

<p>Humiliated and angry, afraid that she would laugh
and yet wanting to cry, Augusta would jump up into
her seat and drive brusquely off, Jimmie swaying on the
step and waving apologies for his untimely departure.
To her shame, he actually did sell three bottles of cod
liver oil, which he had himself refused to take. When,
however, she caught him dressing up as hair restorer
the bottle of harness oil which Mary Donahue's care
had provided, Augusta asserted genuine authority and
this outlet of his genius was stopped.</p>

<p>But in the matter of horse trading she found that she
had no influence whatever. With a cheery hail and a
wave of the arm he would stop anybody who drove a
horse and proceed to ask pertinent and leading questions
about the horse which the other person drove.
And if he could but awaken in his listener's eye the
faintest gleam of our American rural passion he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
be down on the ground instantly, walking around the
stranger's horse, squinting severely at him, cataloguing
his points in technical terms wonderfully misplaced,
with a dispassionate, steady flow of bewildering language,
until his listener in sheer self defense turned the
inquiry upon Donahue.</p>

<p>Jimmie would then throw up his head, one ear cocked
in the air in that way he had, as though some new and
interesting fact had been brought to his attention. Then
he would talk of Donahue.</p>

<p>On ordinary days, when Jimmie was in no more than
his usual good strain of talk, Donahue was only a pure
blooded Arabian bay from a race of desert horses, whose
breed and pedigree had been guarded jealously through
a thousand years by Jimmie's own forbears. But when
Jimmie was having a good day Donahue was apotheosized.
He, Donahue, was in fact a lineal descendant
of the fay white horses that used to run wild under the
lakes in Ireland in the days of the giants. Jimmie reminded
his listener truculently that Colonel Roosevelt
had written all about these things in his studies of the
Irish Sagas, and he dared him to admit that he had not
read anything of it. Our rural people do not like to admit
complete ignorance of any given thing. They generally
agreed that they "had heard something about it."</p>

<p>That was enough for Jimmie's case. Donahue's rusty
color proved the matter&mdash;Those horses would certainly
have turned rusty after all that water.</p>

<p>It was in vain that Augusta explained to Jimmie that
these people really thought him crazy, and that they
only listened to him and humored him because they
were afraid that he would turn violent. Not argument,
nor ridicule, nor even tears could break him from his
mania of proposing to trade Donahue to every person
who drove a horse and who could be persuaded to stop
and listen to him. And Augusta could only sit in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
place, smothering her laughter and her anger until he
was willing to break off his farce and drive on.</p>

<p>She remembered one awful day in the Mohawk Valley
between Little Falls and Herkimer when he had
stopped in succession, and labored with, a candidate for
Congress, who foolishly tried to sow the good political
seed which was quickly blown away in the breeze of
Jimmie's zeal, with a butcher, with a jolly old farmer
who declared that if he had Jimmie's tongue he would
go on the road himself, with a capable spinster who
drove a smart horse and plainly showed that she would
have liked to crack her whip at Jimmie's ear, with a
veterinary surgeon&mdash;with whom he nearly came to
blows, and with a minister of the Gospel.</p>

<p>Now their way was quieter, for they had left the
main travelled roads at Remsen and were faring straight
into the heart of the hills. "You can follow the M. &amp; M.
from Remsen," Mary Donahue had told Augusta. "We
never go that way, for there's no people much and the
roads are rough. But that's where the sick people all
go. And you'll be all right. Just keep somewhere not
too far from the railroad. There's always some kind of a
road, and you can't get lost when you're not going
anywhere in particular anyway."</p>

<p>Augusta had as yet no definite plans. She had not
indeed thought of the need of any plans. Never had two
birds set forth on flight into the northland with less
thought of the end of the summer than Augusta and
Jimmie had taken of where they might be when the
nip of chilly nights should come to warn them that the
summer was over. Augusta had thought only of a long,
long summer of happy drifting before the end of which
Jimmie would somehow be wonderfully cured. And
beyond that point her thought had not gone.</p>

<p>With the sight of the solid hills before her, into which
they had been slowly climbing for some days, it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
that the future was suddenly drawing up to them with a
sharpened, stiffened outline. The hills looked so definite
and decided that it seemed almost an impertinence to
go wandering at will among them without object or
settled purpose. Their very stillness and the steady,
ordered lines of them as they tiered up, hill behind hill,
to meet the rising sun, reminded Augusta that even
here the rule of order of the world held good. People
must not go on too long trusting to the future just because
the future is a vague thing and far away.</p>

<p>The days along the road had taught her many things,
and here where they were almost in the big woods her
eyes and ears were being sharpened in the silences to
learn and to understand the life of the little wild things
that rustled and scuttled through the grass and twittered
in the tree-tops and called sleepily to each other
in the twilight.</p>

<p>Last night at dusk she had walked out on a bridge
over a swampy creek and had seen a muskrat jump
from the tall grass of the bank into the water and swim
in a straight line, only the tip of his nose showing above
the water, right to his house. Then she had thought
only of how swiftly and quietly he had slipped away.
Now she remembered that the largest part of his wild
wisdom was that he had a home to get into and that he
knew just where it was.</p>

<p>And yesterday she had seen a dog chasing another
dog&mdash;Jimmie said it was a woodchuck, but she had no
great faith in Jimmie's wood lore. It was too universal,
too impromptu and, alas! too agreeable and accomodating.
The woodchuck&mdash;if Jimmie was right&mdash;had
vanished suddenly in the middle of a bare, open field.
He had a place to go to and he knew just where it was.</p>

<p>Even the melancholy owls who spread pessimism
through the night were probably hooting each on his
own doorstep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
She and Jimmie were not fitted with the instincts of
these little wild things, to have a refuge always at hand
against the storm that was sure to come.</p>

<p>And she had noticed that the smaller these wild
things were the better they were equipped, in their
apparent helplessness, to escape danger. The little
meadow bird building her nest in the open field was the
very color of the grass that stood up above her. And
the busy woodpecker was invisible against the bark of
the tree where he worked for his living.</p>

<p>Looking up at the suggestive strength of the hills
Augusta thought how little and how unready people
were in this great world that knew so well its own laws
and how to take care of itself. And of all people she was
sure that she and Jimmie were the least equipped, the
least ready for the test of life in the swift sweeping
changes that nature's order brings.</p>

<p>A little worried frown came clouding down over the
morning light in Augusta's face and a sharp little
crease of trouble set itself straight down in the middle
of her forehead.</p>

<p>A new sound came now striking persistently at her
attention and lifting finally, by a fresh interest, the
worried frown. For many minutes she had been listening
intermittently and subconsciously to what was
evidently a connubial argument in a tree-top. Two
birds were talking about her, or at least Augusta took
the argument to herself and had been translating it
idly into unconscious words while her thoughts were
busy elsewhere.</p>

<p>An energetic, housewifely voice had been complaining
insistently:</p>

<p class="bm0 nostanza">"Why <i>don't</i> she get <i>up</i>-ee?</p>

<p class="p0 nostanza">"Why <i>don't</i> she get <i>up</i>-ee?"</p>

<p class="in0">And a somewhat sleepy, tolerant, patently male, voice
answered back good naturedly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
"Let'er <i>sleep</i>, let'er <i>sleep</i>."</p>

<p class="in0">The colloquy had rambled intermittently into other
matters, but Augusta felt guiltily sure that the energetic
housewife in the treetop had an eye upon her, for every
little while she brought the dialogue back to</p>

<p class="bm0 nostanza">"Why <i>don't</i> she get <i>up</i>-ee?</p>

<p class="p0 nostanza">"Why <i>don't</i> she get <i>up</i>-ee?"</p>

<p class="in0">And male laziness answered comfortably:</p>

<p>"Let'er <i>sleep</i>, let'er <i>sleep</i>."</p>

<p>The sound that now broke off her half listening
reverie was a short, plunking noise of something dropping
into the little pond near which the wagon stood.
Could it be that some boy on the hill at the other side
was throwing stones into the pond.</p>

<p>She turned on her shoulder to watch the surface of
the pond. Certainly there were the ripples spreading out
in gentle waving circles from a centre at which something
must have fallen into the pond. As her eye followed
the waving circle toward the farther bank, right
in the line of her vision there sprang straight out of
the mirrored water a beautiful, tapering, black, silver
and green body, that seemed to hang suspended an
instant in a glistening arch and then dropped like a
silver knife, without a splash, and was gone.</p>

<p>Augusta lay for a moment staring bewildered at the
spot where the vision had disappeared.</p>

<p>Then she sprang for her dressing curtain and began to
scuffle into her clothes. "If that fish would only wait!"</p>

<p>Jimmie had bought fish lines at a country store the
other day and had rigged a pole after the manner that
he had learned during boyhood summers in the country.
Yesterday he had persisted in stopping to fish this
stream lower down at a place that looked promising.
And Augusta had jeered good-naturedly at him, and even
Donahue had kicked, when the only result had been
that they were all horridly bitten by great black flies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Now yesterday's scepticism was forgotten. Jimmie
should have fish for breakfast!&mdash;she knew how he sometimes
loathed the milk and eggs that she forced upon
him. But even this was an afterthought. She had seen
her prey, and the fever of the hunt was tingling in her
fingers as she tore the pole loose from its fastenings on
the top of the wagon and grabbed a bit of pork rind for
bait, jabbing it on to the hook as she ran down to the
pond and around to the side where she had seen the
bass.</p>

<p>Probably she expected him to be there waiting for
her, for when she had looked sharply at the place where
he had disappeared, and could see nothing, she did not
know what to do.</p>

<p>She remembered that Jimmie had just dropped the
bait to the surface and drawn it up again slowly, here
and there at random without knowing whether there
was a fish near or not. Obviously, Jimmie's way had
been wrong, for he had caught nothing; and how could
he expect to catch a fish if he didn't know where the
fish was?</p>

<p>She decided to wait and see if he would not come up
again. He did. Away at the farthest bend of the pond
she heard the swish of his body as he leaped and was in
time to see the silver flash of him shooting down into
the water.</p>

<p>She started to run around the bank, but an instinct
of primitive wiliness caught her and, instead, she
dropped down flat and motionless in the grass at the
very edge of the bank. That fish was hers. She knew
it with a sudden fierceness of possession which if she
had been able to think of herself would have shocked
her. She would have fought the world with teeth and
nails for him. But she knew that she would not get
him by running after him. She would wait and make
him come to her. Slowly and carefully she let the pole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
out over the water, the bait swinging gently just above
the surface.</p>

<p>The sun was shining down past her shoulders as
she lay there watching fiercely, and she was surprised
to see the bottom of the pond clearly outlined in rocks
and sand. It was her first real sight of sun-shot water
in the hills, and to her whose city experience had told
her that all ponds were dark and bottomless it would,
at any other time, have been wonderful. Now it only
meant that she would have that fish if she had to go
into the pond after him. There was only one fish,
she thought; so the contest was narrowed down to
the personal bitterness of a duel.</p>

<p>She saw a thin dark line shoot across a bed of white
sand. Could that be merely a fish swimming, that
streak of playing lightning that had crossed again, under
her fascinated eyes?</p>

<p>He had seen the shadow of the bait moving on the
surface of the water, and he was, for a reason about
which Augusta knew nothing, even more excited than
the tensely nerved girl who watched for him, her head
now leaning out over the bank, the weight of half her
body resting on one elbow that dug a socket for itself
in the dirt at the extreme edge of the bank.</p>

<p>Again he came shooting across over the bed of sand
where she could see him clearly, and again, before she
had time to do more than edge a little farther out
over the bank in her excitement, he flew back across
the line of her vision.</p>

<p>Now she was sure that he had seen the bait, for he
came shooting past more swiftly, if it could be, and
with shorter and shorter dashes, each time swimming
closer to where the shadow fell upon the water. Swifter
and shorter came his rushes, now almost underneath
the shadow of the bait. Augusta trembled in her eagerness
to drop the bait to the water. But a cunning instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
told her that he was not ready, that her prey was
not yet worked up to the point of striking.</p>

<p>Hard as it was, she must still wait, fearing every
instant that he would rise and miss the hook, but not
yet daring to drop the bait upon the water.</p>

<p>Finally, when she was grinding her teeth to keep
her hold upon her trembling muscles, she saw him
coming; this time from a longer dash than he had
been taking, and swifter, and straight at the shadow.</p>

<p>She plumped the bait down on the water.</p>

<p>In the little ripple of the surface she lost sight of
him, thought that she had frightened him away, had
lost him. And the reaction, the feeling of failure turned
her weak and nerveless.</p>

<p>She had no time to be conscious of the violent yank
upon the pole, for with it she was toppled over the
edge of the bank and found herself rolling down into
the water.</p>

<p>She was horribly, sickeningly frightened as she
struck the water and she did cry out Jimmie's name.
But when she felt the pole being drawn from the hand
that still held it she gripped it fiercely with both hands
and began to fight.</p>

<p>She was on her knees now and struggling to her
feet in the water, while the fish shooting about in
narrow circles drew the line through the water like a
flashing knife. It was battle now, her strength against
his strength and cunning. She did not know what to
do, except to pull and try to lift him out of the water.
And she found that she could do neither, for it was
taking every ounce of her strength merely to keep
from being jerked from her slippery footing down into
the deeper water.</p>

<p>She must somehow get back upon the bank for she
had no strength here where her feet had nothing to
brace upon. Back and forth along the shifting bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
she struggled, fighting for a foothold, falling and stumbling
up again, but never loosening the death grip of
her hands on the pole. Her knuckles were bruised and
stinging and she knew that her knee was cut where
she had fallen, but she had no thought of giving up
or even of calling for Jimmie.</p>

<p>There was no joy of battle now, nor was it a game
that she played. It was a desperate, racking struggle
merely to hold her own, and she was fighting blindly,
without plan and without cunning.</p>

<p>Once the pull on the line suddenly slackened and
she almost fell over backwards, ready to cry, because
she thought the line had broken.</p>

<p>Then straight out of the water and leaping towards
her came the fish. Augusta leaped back up the bank,
and it was her fright at this point&mdash;she actually
thought that the fish was coming to attack her&mdash;that
changed the luck of the battle.</p>

<p>Here, on her feet on the firm ground, she felt that
she was the stronger, and while her strength was with
her she was going to make one mighty try at lifting
him out of the water.</p>

<p>She braced herself, craftily waiting until the fish in
his rushes should give her a little slack in the line.
Then she threw her whole body into a straining heave
at the pole.</p>

<p>At that instant the fish struck downward desperately.
The two forces met midway of the pole. Augusta
heard a loud crack and found herself tumbling backward,
still holding the useless end of the broken pole.</p>

<p>When she looked and saw the other half of the pole
shooting across the pond she screamed for Jimmie
and gave chase.</p>

<p>As she ran around the edge of the pond Augusta
was fighting mad. She was angry now at herself for
calling to Jimmie. And at the very first chance she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
was going right into the pond and put an end to that
fish.</p>

<p>She came around to the side nearest the wagon and
here, because it seemed like her own ground, and the
sand shelved gently out into the water, she ran boldly
in half way to the centre of the pond and grabbed at
the pole as it went shooting by.</p>

<p>The first time she missed it in her eagerness and
nearly fell into deep water. But she got her footing
again and waited. Once the pole sailed by well out of
her reach, but the next time as the fish circled he
swerved sharply after he had passed Augusta and his
quick turn slewed the broken end of the pole around
almost to her hand. She grabbed it and ran, literally
ran, out of the pond and up the bank, dragging after
her by main strength the pole, the line and the fish.</p>

<p>It was a most unsportsmanlike and unfair procedure.
The fish could have had her haled before any angler's
court and condemned by all the laws and canons of
the sport. But Augusta ruthlessly dragged him up
through the sand and the dust to the grass.</p>

<p>When she thought that he was safely far enough
from the water, she turned to look at her prize.</p>

<p>Donahue, too, sniffing interestedly came ambling
along for a view of the happenings.</p>

<p>The sight of the fish did not please Augusta. He was
black and dirty and he squirmed disgustingly. And
he had covered himself with a loathesome coating of
muddied dust.</p>

<p>Her idea of a fish in captivity was of one frozen
restfully in colors into the middle of a block of ice in a
butcher's window.</p>

<p>When she looked closer at the fish she saw that he
was bleeding dirtily from the gills. She turned weakly
sick and remorseful.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry!" she cried. "Oh, I'm so sorry! Please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
go back. Please! And I'll never fish again!" She dropped
limply down to the ground and began to cry bitterly.</p>

<p>The fish was flopping his blind way back to the
pond, when Donahue, with every appearance of studied
intention, dropped a blundering foot upon the dragging
line, and stood still contemplating affairs&mdash;thereby
saving Jimmie's breakfast.</p>

<p>So Jimmie, getting sleepily down from the wagon to
investigate the commotion, found his wife sitting disconsolate
and soggy on the grass, her face streaked
with muddy tears, the accomplished Donahue standing
foolishly ruminative in the middle of the picture, and
a very dirty fish fighting for liberty at the end of the
line.</p>

<p>Jimmie hurried Augusta to the wagon for repairs,
and took charge of the fish.</p>

<p>He cooked it and had to eat it all himself while
Augusta sipped remorsefully at the milk and eggs
which Jimmie hated.</p>

<p>Now if Augusta had known the reason why her bass
had struck so quickly, and so viciously, at her baited
hook she would have been much more disturbed and
remorseful than she actually was.</p>

<p>The truth is that among river and brook fish the
black bass is the only true and proper father of family.
The males of the other brook tribes, once their young
have been hatched, exhibit only the most casual and
meandering attention toward their welfare. They seem
to think that they have done enough when they have
seen their offspring born in water. Let them swim,
then, is their attitude.</p>

<p>The black bass is, on the extreme other hand, a
most worried and fretsome pater familias. In the period
while his young are dependent and helpless his responsibilities
weigh upon him severely. He is worried
by trifles, and even by non-existent things, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
business of being a new father is with him a matter of
all-absorbing agitation.</p>

<p>Take a stout man, preferably somewhat bald, just
under the line of forty, say, and consider him in the
days when his first child has just come into the stages
of breath holding and threatened spasms. Regard him
as he tip-toes about the house in under-shirt and
trousers and worried ferocity. Study him as he walks
the floor through the hours of the night warding off
imaginary dangers with agitated anger and gentle
hearted ignorance. Cross this man at this time in
anything that in the remotest way touches the future
of his family and you will rouse a deadly enemy.</p>

<p>So your black bass. At all other times he is cautious,
wary, worldly wise. But at this time of his family's
helplessness he is rash, careless and blind in his hot
anger at anything that threatens them. He will strike
madly at anything that comes near the surface of his
pond. He will snap rashly at a fly, at a twig dropped
on the water, at a shadow, at a bare hook, even, if
he can see it.</p>

<p>He lives in a constant ramp of shifting, hurrying,
belligerent, aggressive defense. He is not hungry or
greedy as he seems to act. He is whole-heartedly and
defiantly defending his own and his home against what
he is convinced is a jealous and a hostile world.</p>

<p>Augusta, mercifully, knew none of these things. She
had blundered into tragedy as unknowingly as Donahue's
wandering foot had chanced to rest upon the
line and save Jimmie a welcome breakfast of fish.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<p>All through a long, drowsy, dreamy afternoon while
Donahue had taken very much his own way and gait,
Augusta had watched the unfolding of the hills before
them. They had passed Old Forge and the Divide where
the water-sheds drop off to north and west, and were
deep in the bosom of the hills. At times, for a little
while, they seemed to be on the very top of all the hills,
for they could see north, east, south and west, a broken
picture of jutting rocks and dipping green, and the
blue haze of distance running like a ribbon around it
all. Then, for hours, they would be plodding noiselessly
along, shut securely in a pocket, with only a few rods
of the winding road showing before them and the walls
of the hills closed in about them on all sides.</p>

<p>Somehow Augusta knew that they were soon going to
find the home for which they were both longing. She
knew that Jimmie was weary of the road. He did not
say so. He never complained, she had learned that. It
was useless to try to know what he felt from what he
said. But when he was too quiet she knew that he was
either feeling worse again&mdash;and it was not that&mdash;or he
was weary of what they were doing and wanted to be
doing something else.</p>

<p>Augusta did not blame him. Indeed she would have
been sorry if he had taken too easily to the useless, idle
drifting of the road. His restlessness now proved that
he was not content to drift towards whatever lay before
them. It was the one thing of which she had been
afraid when she had taken responsibility away from him
and had bundled him off on the road as she had done.</p>

<p>Now she saw that the danger which she had imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
was not threatening. Jimmie was fretting to get back
his grip on life. He wanted to be putting his hand to
something, to be doing something, to be getting somewhere.
With all his surface nonsense and his ways of an
ungrown boy, Augusta knew the hot rage of ambition
that had burned within him. And she knew that with
returning strength it would come to flame again. It must
not be allowed to eat hopelessly at him while they
drifted aimlessly along a seemingly endless road.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon they came dropping down from a
ridge into Smedley village. Augusta read the name on a
white sign over the post office door. It seemed to be the
end of the highway, for the road which they had been
following appeared just to stumble on weakly, between
the six houses on the one side and the four houses and
little white school on the other, out into a rising field
and to lose itself there.</p>

<p>Augusta went into the post office to buy bread, bacon,
matches and soap. While the postmaster filled her order
she inquired:</p>

<p>"Where does the road go from here?"</p>

<p>The stout old man beamed benignly on Augusta's
happy, browned, open-eyed face. Then he squinted
cautiously out through the door at the wagon which
was unmistakably gypsy. He could not place her.</p>

<p>"Where was you calc'latin' to go, missy?" he evaded
with the usual rural unwillingness to give any information
until he had first received some.</p>

<p>"Oh, nowhere," Augusta confessed. "My husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you're right there. You don't need to go
another step. This is nowhere. The last place you
stopped at was next to nowhere, and Smedley, here, is
it itself," he grumbled, without any ill humor. "I been
waitin' here forty year for that road to go somewhere.
But it aint gone and it aint goin', not so it appears.
There aint no place for it to go to. That bacon's been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
around here a good while, too," he interpolated thoughtfully.
"But the soap's prime&mdash;staple as old cheese.
No sir, there aint no other place beyond this. This is
nowhere. When you get here you have to stay or go
back."</p>

<p>"But people do stay here," said Augusta a little
thoughtfully, "and live and keep well," she added,
eyeing the ruddy, well nourished, well preserved face of
the old man.</p>

<p>"Of course they do," he admitted. "What else is
there for 'em to do. There's no doctors here, so they
can't get sick. And there's no preachers to make 'em
think about dyin'. So they just hang 'round."</p>

<p>"But it seems a nice place to stay around in," said
Augusta as she stood on the little porch of the post
office and looked around at the comfort and security of
the solid little houses with the strength of the hills
behind them.</p>

<p>"Any place is nice, if you don't <i>have</i> to stay there,"
the old man grumbled, following Augusta out to the
wagon. He took a sharp look up at Jimmie, and seemed
to like him instantly.</p>

<p>"If you folks," he remarked pleasantly as Augusta
climbed lightly into the wagon, "didn't look so much
like a pair of runaway children, I'd say you was looking
for a place to make a nest."</p>

<p>Augusta and Jimmie looked quickly at each other and
then they both laughed in sudden mutual understanding.
They had each been thinking the same thought all
day, but neither had said anything of it. Jimmie
laughed.</p>

<p>"Do you do a little mind reading on the side?" he
inquired, "besides holding up a wing of the United
States government and supplying the countryside with
dry goods and groceries."</p>

<p>"Well, you know," the old man winked genially, "or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
you soon will know, married men has to make a good
many shifts in order to scrape 'round."</p>

<p>"You are profoundly right," said Jimmie solemnly,
"Mr.&mdash;Gamblin? Is that the name I see on the window?"</p>

<p>"Jethniah Gamblin, that's me. Just like a post in the
mud. Been here for forty year and sorry for it every
minute."</p>

<p>"But you stay."</p>

<p>"It's a habit."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jimmie thoughtfully, "it's an old habit
that people have of staying in places. The fact is my
wife and I are just now both tired of wandering, though
we hadn't thought to tell each other about it until you
mentioned it."</p>

<p>"You see," Augusta took up the explanations, while
Mr. Gamblin settled a heavy foot on the hub of the
wheel and went into conference with them, "Jimmie
hasn't been well. Not really sick, you know, but just&mdash;he
coughed a good deal. And we came out like gypsies,
you know we're not really gypsies at all," she elucidated
carefully. "And now I'm sure he's tired of it. It's so
easy to tire of a thing that isn't after all quite natural."</p>

<p>"Well now," Mr. Gamblin began helpfully, "there's
as much room right in sight here as you'll find most
anywheres. And there's a balsam ridge right over that
shoulder of hill there that when the wind is right is
better for a cough than anything that ever came out of a
doctor's shop."</p>

<p>Jimmie, whose eyes still had their trick of watching
for the details of every picture, noticed an angry twitching
of the vine that screened a window in the wing of
the post office building, where, probably, Mr. Gamblin
lived. He deduced that there was a woman behind that
vine listening. And the woman was getting angry.</p>

<p>"Oh, that sounds so good!" Augusta enthused immediately.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
"You know, we've only got a little money. And
it has to last. You know if we had a plenty we wouldn't
have to think or worry at all. But then, if we had money
it would be something else."</p>

<p>"Golly! You're right," the old man agreed with a
hearty slap on his knee. "And the fryin' pan can't be
quite so hot as the fire anyway. So if you can only
just&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jeth-<i>nye</i>-yah! You left the 'lasses runnin'!"</p>

<p>Mr. Gamblin jumped into the air as though at the
crack of a whip.</p>

<p>He came down nimbly on his feet and started a bolt
for the door of the post office. He took, however, only
a few hurried steps. Then he stopped short with a
thud and an angry grunt. He shook himself viciously
like an enraged and baffled bull, and it seemed that he
was about to roar.</p>

<p>Jimmie knew at once that the woman behind the
screen of vines had played a ruse&mdash;probably an old
one&mdash;upon the old gentleman, to make him break off an
interesting conversation.</p>

<p>Augusta, not understanding at all, and wishing to go
on with the discussion, said helpfully:</p>

<p>"But I'm sure you didn't touch the molasses at
all."</p>

<p>Jimmie put his hand warningly upon her arm.</p>

<p>Mr. Gamblin did not appear to hear her. He was
standing with his legs braced wide apart. His mild
mannered spectacles which seemed to have no relations
whatever with his eyes stood out at a truculent angle
near the end of his nose. His face and neck were very
red and he had the look of a man fighting for breath.</p>

<p>"Forty year!" he muttered belligerently, "just like
a post in the mud! An' sorry every minute!"</p>

<p>Then he shook himself and strode stubbornly back
to the wagon, placed his foot solidly where it had before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
rested on the hub of the wheel, and renewed his conversation
in a loud and defiant tone.</p>

<p>"Yessum, there's as good air right 'round here as
there is anywhere, and more of it than there is in most
places."</p>

<p>Jimmie wondered sympathetically how many times
in the forty years the old man had been called away
from some interesting doing by that false alarm about
the molasses.</p>

<p>"And what's a little cough anyway?" the old man
boomed on resonantly. "Why I had a tarnation mean
cough one time, my own self, long about twenty years
ago, I figure it was, or twenty-five. Come on in hayin'
time and hung 'round till the first frost. That's the cure.
The first nip of the dry frost just picks it right out.
And there you are, sound as a trivet. Just like a post in
the mud!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you are right," said Augusta. "And I know
that Jimmie and I are both tired of drifting. I don't
think we will go much farther."</p>

<p>"Well, just mosey 'round and see for yourselves.
Maybe you'll find just the place you want. And if
anybody asks, tell 'em Jeth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jethniah Gamblin," the voice from behind the vines
rasped out spitefully, "don't you dare go bringin' no
lung folks to stoppin' here. You know well enough what
happened up at Fenton Lake. The sick folks come there
and got well, and the well folks took it and got sick.
And&mdash;"</p>

<p>They did not hear any more, for Augusta had
grabbed the whip and brought it down wickedly on the
unoffending back of Donahue. The astonished animal
started with a leap that threw Jimmie and Augusta
backwards in a huddle and nearly knocked Mr. Gamblin
flat to the ground.</p>

<p>When Jimmie had recovered himself and gotten hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the reins he looked back. The old man was standing
almost where they had left him, and although Jimmie
could see that he was now white with anger yet there
was a droop of humiliation and shame on the kindly,
sturdy old figure that made Wardwell genuinely sorry
for him.</p>

<p>Augusta was now sobbing hysterically:</p>

<p>"Please, please, Donahue, forgive me! I didn't mean
to hurt you! You know I didn't mean it!" She could
see the line in the dusty hair of his back where she had
struck him and to her eyes it seemed a livid welt.
"Oh, how could she be so hard?" she wailed. "I could
go back and tear her eyes out! I don't see why God
doesn't choke people when they say things like
that!"</p>

<p>"There, there, dear," said Jimmie soothingly, putting
one arm around her while he steadied Donahue with the
other, "we musn't mind that. People say things like
that without thinking."</p>

<p>"But she hurt you! And she hadn't even seen you!
And I hurt Donahue! And she doesn't get hurt at all!
Oh, it isn't right, it isn't right!" she wailed.</p>

<p>"Of course not, dear. But see," Jimmie began,
gathering himself to talk Augusta out of her feeling, for
it always worried him to see her under a strong emotion,
"you know she didn't really mean what she said at
all. She wasn't thinking of that, not a minute. She
meant something else, entirely different. Do you want
to know what she really meant when she said that?"</p>

<p>Augusta stopped tentatively and looked up miserably
through her tears.</p>

<p>"Well, what she meant was this," said Jimmie
blandly. "She meant that friend Jethniah was philandering
too much time over the affairs of a very attractive
gypsy. <i>I</i> did not matter, and Donahue was just
like any ordinary horse so far as she was concerned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
The point was that the bold Jethniah was dallying
with a fair female.</p>

<p>"What know we," he declaimed, getting into his
stride, while Donahue, comforted and reassured by
the well known sound of the harangue, steadied himself
down to a walk, "of the restless nights and the
heavy days that yonder virtuous woman has suffered
from the meanderings of Jethniah? He is a personable,
plausible man with a roving eye. He has a gift for
conversation and an eye for beauty. Even his references
to a post in the mud show a discontented, restless
disposition. You heard him mention the post in the
mud? It is proof patent that his thoughts are wanderers.</p>

<p>"Then, too, he is a man of consequence and of travel.
I saw the stage back of the house. It proves that he
himself journeys daily down to the railroad to get the
mail, to carry the passengers, if any there be&mdash;You
notice that I stick to the bare facts, there may not be
any passengers, but if any there be&mdash;and to mingle
with the gay world that whirls by.</p>

<p>"Fifthly and sixthly; he is the postmaster. We can
only vaguely appreciate what that means. He has the
first read at every postal card that comes into these
hills. He knows everybody's secrets. Do you realize
the hold that gives him on the imaginations of the
female portion of this high and wide community?</p>

<p>"He knows the ins and the outs. The devious ways
of the female mind are to him an open book. He pats
the shoulder of widowed sorrow. He consoles the lovelorn
maiden and invents all too welcome excuses for
the letter that does not come. He is even capable of
writing letters himself to take the place of the missing
ones. Given the man, the temptation, and the immunity
of his position, and there are no heights of
rascality that he might not scale."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
"I don't care," said Augusta hotly. "I'm sure he is a
good kind man."</p>

<p>And that's all right! thought Jimmie, pleased and
proud to have drawn Augusta out to argue, and flushed
for further triumphs.</p>

<p>"There you have it! He is kind," he echoed. "You
have touched the very key spring of his villainy. What
man was ever kind but to beguile? From our ancient
friend Leander at the swimming bee down to young
John W. Lothario himself they all had kind hearts
and were willing to share them with any and every
lady within the horizon line. And here is our Jethniah
the very prize dandler of them all. For forty years
he has gone up and down these hills and has ranged
far and wide, even as far as the railroad, interesting
himself in the trials of beauty in distress, while his
own lawful wife and spouse languished behind the
vines.</p>

<p>"Think of the tale of these doings that she could
tell! And she <i>would</i> tell them, too. In fact I'd wager
that she <i>has</i> told them, numerously, circumstantially,
and in detail, for a good many hours out of the forty
years," he concluded with a grin.</p>

<p>Augusta was quiet now. She had nestled in close
under Jimmie's shoulder and seemed to have forgotten
Jethniah and his wife.</p>

<p>"Jimmie."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;Oh&mdash;Do you think I hurt Donahue very
much?"</p>

<p>Jimmie considered, squinting thoughtfully along
Donahue's dusty back. He was sure that Augusta
had intended, and had tried, to say something entirely
different.</p>

<p>"Well," he answered critically and judicially, "he
<i>does</i> seem to be unusually sleepy. But whether it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
from the effects of your blow or from the soporific influence
of my discourse would be hard to say."</p>

<p>Donahue ambled on up a gently winding track&mdash;it
was not quite a road&mdash;which was entirely of his
own choosing.</p>

<p>"Jimmie."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>She nestled closer, and Jimmie waited.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?"</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>"Me?" Jimmie inquired blankly, wondering what
he had been doing now.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid of the time when you get all well and
yourself again. You'll want to wander."</p>

<p>"Like Jethniah, eh? There now, what did I tell
you? That's what comes of listening to him. You think
that, like him, the whole male world is uncertain, coy
and hard to please."</p>

<p>"Please, Jimmie, don't head me off. I'm afraid. I
suppose love makes cowards of us all. Do you remember
a time when I said that I wouldn't want to keep even
a kitten that didn't want to stay?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but that was before we were married!" he
explained airily. "We all talk turkey at a time like
that. It's the last chance we get. And we spend the rest
of our lives trying to pay the bets."</p>

<p>"Jimmie."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear?"</p>

<p>"Do you remember the lady I saw you talking with
that day in the Square?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Jimmie lightly, "Jean Bradley"&mdash;They
were far away now, it seemed to him, and the
name meant nothing to either of them&mdash;, "what about
her?"</p>

<p>"And the woman in the cards, do you remember?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
"You mean the one the gypsy girl wanted to claw
me about? Oh yes."</p>

<p>"They were the same woman."</p>

<p>"Same woman?" asked Jimmie, mentally pawing
about for firm ground.</p>

<p>"It was the same dark, handsome woman, in the
cards, I saw her."</p>

<p>"Saw&mdash;&mdash;?" For one rare and breathless moment
Jimmie was completely dumbfounded. He could not
find a word anywhere. But he reacted bravely.</p>

<p>"Well if you saw her," he exclaimed eagerly, "why
the deuce didn't you tell her that you'd collect the
money she owes us?"</p>

<p>"Please, Jimmie, don't joke. I'm trying to say
something that's hard to say. You know when we
stood before the priest I promised, in my heart, that
if I ever thought you wanted to go away from me I
would not only let you go but I would force you to be
free, by going away and hiding myself."</p>

<p>Jimmie said nothing. He sat looking stupidly at
Donahue's ear, his hands clutching the reins so that
they were cutting into his flesh. There was nothing to
be said. Better let her talk this out for herself.</p>

<p>"And now," she went on fearfully, "I'm afraid,
afraid of that woman. And I'm going to do a cowardly
thing. I'm afraid of the test, afraid of myself. Jimmie,
I'm going to ask you to promise something. I know it's
going back on my own heart promise, but I can't
help it&mdash;I can't help it!"</p>

<p>Jimmie saw that she was suffering, and trembling
with fear and self reproach, and he did the best he
could. He said:</p>

<p>"Let's drive back, and I'll choke Jethniah's wife
to death with the soap. She's to blame for all
this."</p>

<p>"But will you promise, Jimmie?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
"Of course, I'll promise! What is it, dear?" He was
ready to promise her the setting sun.</p>

<p>"Will you promise me never to have anything to do
with that woman?"</p>

<p>"Jean Bradley? Why, yes, sure I promise, if you
wish it. That's easy, and all settled. We'll probably
never see her again anyway. But I do wish you had
put in something about Jethniah's wife. If ever a woman
deserved choking, and with soap&mdash;I insist on the soap,
it is certainly that woman."</p>

<p>But Augusta was not to be turned aside by his diversion.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," she confessed, shrinking in closer to
him so that she seemed so little and so forlorn that
Jimmie instinctively put his hand on hers to stop her,
"afraid that I would be coward enough to want you
to stay even if I knew you wanted to go. And then
you'd begin to talk. And you'd be so kind and so bright
and jolly that I'd begin to let myself be fooled. You
know how you can talk. You can make anybody almost
believe anything. Please, darling," she pleaded, "promise
you won't ever use it to deceive me!"</p>

<p>Wardwell silently cursed the gift of his glib and
ready tongue, while he tried to find the right words
for this. After a little he said humbly:</p>

<p>"Augusta, to your knowledge I'm a good many
kinds of a fool. But let me tell you something that I
know about you, and me. If I should ever be that
particular kind of fool, do you know what would
happen? Well, in the first place, you'd know it before
I knew it myself. And before I'd get around to know
it, you'd snap me loose and send me spinning so fast
that I'd never know just what happened."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimmie, don't let me think of it! I could not
bear it, and live."</p>

<p>"There are other, more immediate, things to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
thought of. Our patient Donahue is thinking hard on
some of them this minute. In the first place, he is
wondering if he is expected to work nights."</p>

<p>Donahue, who was by now accustomed to the name
which had been thrust upon him, stopped and looked
around at Augusta.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Donahue," she apologized cheerfully.
"I know you are hungry and so is Jimmie. And it's
all my fault. But really we can't stop right here. This
is just the middle of a field. We'll just go on up to
the edge of that little woods. And there we'll stop all
day tomorrow, if you like, and think about things."</p>

<p>Jimmie tightened up on the rein, and Donahue
plodded on obediently.</p>

<p>The track which they followed came again to the
edge of a brook which they had been crossing and re-crossing
now for two days. And they knew from the
limpid clearness of the water and the slight thread of
its rapid flow that they must be near its headwaters.
Across its little valley, straight in front of them, stood
a thin wall of tall, handsome maple trees, which thickened
and deepened into a heavy green bank of solid
forest as either end of the line ran up to the enclosing
heights above the valley.</p>

<p>The cool, sharp breath of a hidden mountain lake
came down to them, and Donahue smartened up his
gait.</p>

<p>As they came up to where they could see through
the fringe of trees, Augusta looked one long moment
and drew in a deep breath of delight and pure joy in
beauty.</p>

<p>A quick grasp of her hand on Jimmie's arm made
him stop the horse. But before he could say a word
she was out over the wheel and running through the
trees, crying:</p>

<p>"It's ours, Jimmie! All alone ours! Nobody told us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
about it! We found it all for ourselves. It is all our
own!"</p>

<p>When Jimmie caught up to her on the bank of the
little lake, she hugged him excitedly and then waved
her arm out over the water.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it the darling! A beautiful white diamond
lying deep in its cushion of green velvet!"</p>

<p>Jimmie admitted quietly that the little five-pointed
lake, lying like a precious white jewel embedded in
the deep green setting of the wooded hills, was the
most beautiful thing that he had ever seen.</p>

<p>The mantle of ready speech seemed to have dropped
from him. He had no words with which to answer
Augusta's enthusiasm. He stood holding her arm, silent
so long that Augusta wondered and looked up at him,
with a question.</p>

<p>"This is the end," he answered quietly, "of our
wanderings. Here are your Hills of Desire."</p>

<p>Augusta nodded, but she did not answer in words.
And Wardwell, watching, saw that strange, strained,
listening look come into her eyes&mdash;the look that used
to frighten him in the days of her trial. The look did
not trouble him now, for he could place against it the
healthy, rugged browned beauty of Augusta's supple
body. Her hold upon earth and the things of life did
not seem at all so slender as it had in those days when
he had almost feared that she would slip away from
him into that strange border land into which she peered
and from which she certainly brought back knowledge.</p>

<p>Now as he held her arm, firm and warm and strong
with the weeks of sunshine and wind and freedom, he
smiled at his fears of those other days and nights. But
when she spoke she startled him more thoroughly
with the quiet certainty of her fore-knowledge than
she had ever done in those other days by her strained
and timid glances into the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
"We shall stay here through the winter," she said,
in the even voice of a dream, "for I can see the snow
on the hillsides and the lake lying wrapped in ice. But
then we will be driven away. I do not know why."</p>

<p>She paused a moment, hesitating, and then hurried
on desperately, as though the vision was slipping from
her:</p>

<p>"We will both be killed, a long, long way from here.
But we won't care!" A little ring, like the sound of
defiant laughter, broke up through the monotone of
her speech, and it alarmed Wardwell so that he took
her forcibly in his arms and almost shook her, to make
her stop. But she went on quickly to the end of her
knowledge:</p>

<p>"I shall be here waiting for you, and you will come.
And we will go on together into the Hills of All Desire!"</p>

<p>She stopped, trembling against him. Jimmie chose
not to answer or to make any comment on what she
had said. From experience he knew that she probably
would not remember just what she had been saying.
He wanted to ignore it altogether. He preferred to
believe that her nerves had merely become over taut
from her excitement of the afternoon and that the
sudden surprise of the beautiful little mountain-locked
lake had played tricks upon them. He looked about for
a diversion, and found one.</p>

<p>Not twenty yards from where they stood, in plain
view, though flanked heavily with trees on both sides,
and some little distance from the water, there was a
small wooden house with an open door. And before
the open door sat a man calmly whittling shavings
for a fire. As Jimmie stared open-mouthed&mdash;he was
almost ready to take oath that neither the house nor
the man had been there before, that they had both
been moved into place there by some stage trick while
his back had been turned&mdash;the man leaned over from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the low stump on which he sat and heaped the shavings
into a neat pile. Then he looked up, and though he
certainly saw Wardwell standing there holding Augusta
he gave no sign whatever that he was aware of them.</p>

<p>Good manners, anyhow! Jimmie commented to
himself.</p>

<p>Then he turned Augusta around to see what he saw,
and said quietly:</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry, dear. But it seems that someone
is here ahead of us."</p>

<p>Augusta looked and saw. But, to Wardwell's relief,
she did not seem to be disturbed or deeply disappointed.</p>

<p>"Well, let's talk to him anyway. Maybe he doesn't
belong here," she whispered. "Maybe he just happened
to stop."</p>

<p>He led her back to where Donahue was patiently
nibbling at some sweet maple shoots and wondering
when this day was going to end, and taking Donahue
by the bridle and Augusta by the arm Wardwell went
forward by the track which he now saw led up to the
open door and presented himself and his retinue to
the leisurely gentleman who seemed to be in possession.</p>

<p>"We didn't mean to come breaking into your camp.
Fact is," Jimmie explained, "we just followed our horse.
And when we saw the lake we just wanted to stay."</p>

<p>As they had approached the man had thrown some
dry sticks on top of the shavings which he had lighted,
and he now straightened and stood up regarding them
whimsically.</p>

<p>He had seen the wagon through the trees long before
they had seen him and had wondered what gypsies
were doing here so far from the ways of their trade.
Now he saw that they were not of any of the kinds of
gypsies that he had ever known. They looked, as Mr.
Gamblin had remarked, exactly like a pair of runaway
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
"I couldn't but see the two of you at the lake," he
said in a rich, soft, South of Ireland brogue that made
Jimmie gasp&mdash;he would as soon have expected to be
stopped here among the trees by a Broadway traffic
policeman as to have heard a voice like that here&mdash;"and
I saw the faces of you when you saw me. You were
two blessed childer runnin' to the end of your rainbow,
an' when you got there, when you got there, here was
an ould dodherin Dimmick sittin' with his hand already
in the pot o' gold."</p>

<p>"But we really hadn't any right to expect to find
such a beautiful place untaken," said Augusta easily.</p>

<p>The man nudged the sticks of the fire gently with his
foot and looked down at Augusta out of a pair of great,
soft blue eyes. He was an enormous man of powerfully
rounded build, as tall as Wardwell but so broad and
solid of stature that, at a little distance he would have
seemed just a well-knit man of medium height.</p>

<p>Wardwell had nothing to say. That wonderful brogue
had silenced him completely. And the man's face was
one which would have drawn attention in any crowd
or setting.</p>

<p>It was a large, clean, unlined face as clear and chubby
as the face of a rugged healthy boy. Yet it had in it the
same quiet power which the man's giant limbs and torso
concealed under their perfect proportions.</p>

<p>Wardwell, on the instant, remembered that he had
seen three faces strikingly like this. One was the face of a
United States senator. Another belonged to a powerful
Anglican bishop. The third was the face of a noted
downtown New York politician who was said now to be
confined in a madhouse. A fantastic suspicion connected
with that third face flashed across Jimmie's
brain and probably showed for an instant in his eyes.
But he almost laughed in the big man's face at the
absurdity of the idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
This man was different. His loose gray shirt and
broad overalls revealed a body that fairly pulsed with
the clean health of years of out of doors, while a gentle,
fine light of sadness and of wholesome humor played
almost imperceptibly in the soft blue eyes. The gray
hair, cut down close and crisp, told of probably sixty
years lightly and soundly lived.</p>

<p>"I'll be moving along early in the morning," he was
saying to Augusta, though he was watching Wardwell
with a gleam in his eyes. He had seen the flash of a
question on Jimmie's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you mustn't do anything of the kind!"
Augusta objected warmly. "Why, we'd just feel that
we had driven you out of your beautiful camp."</p>

<p>"The camp's here all the year, for anybody. 'Tis a
sugar bush, don't you see. Nobody comes here only very
late in the fall, to cut wood for the sugar boiling, and
then again when the winter's breaking up. But for
them two little times, a man might stay here the year
round and nobody be a whit the wiser."</p>

<p>Again Wardwell's instinct for news and for mystery
was roused. He set himself to watch and to
listen.</p>

<p>"Our horse is tired," said Augusta, "and it's night
now, so if you really don't mind we'll stay by the lake
till tomorrow."</p>

<p>"You may stay on in welcome, the whole year if it
suits you. The truth of the whole is, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Evidently he was going to tell something of himself,
but in that instant he caught Wardwell watching him
and he stopped short.</p>

<p>He hesitated, looking sharply at Wardwell, as though
wondering whether he could trust him.</p>

<p>"You may as well stay on," he said finally, with
what seemed a sigh of tired, baffled resignation. "For
I have to be moving on. The truth is, I&mdash;I'm <i>wanted</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
The effect of the last two words on the listeners was
peculiar.</p>

<p>Wardwell, whose mind had been vaguely working
toward some such thought as this announcement implied
and who might have been expected to be somewhat
prepared for it, started sharply and caught
Augusta's arm.</p>

<p>Augusta, on the other hand, who had not anticipated
the man's announcement by the smallest suspicion
and who might reasonably have been expected to be
shocked, spoke interestedly and as though in answer to
what the big man had admitted.</p>

<p>And this is what she said.</p>

<p>"Did you ever know what it is to go six long whole
weeks on stuff that's just been half stewed on a stove
that doesn't hold fire enough to really cook anything?
We've been doing that until there's just one conglomerate
taste in our mouths and we don't know whether
we're eating fish or meat. And all because I haven't
learned to cook with an open fire. I'm going to borrow
your fire right now and beg you to teach me."</p>

<p>The big blue eyes of the old Irishman beamed down
upon her in wonder and appreciation. He was about to
speak, but Augusta was too quick for him. She had
taken her attitude&mdash;it was that they were going to
consider those last two words of his as never having
been spoken&mdash;and she was not to be moved
from it.</p>

<p>"I have bacon," she rattled on, "that the storekeeper
said was as staple as old cheese. No, that was the soap,"
she remembered, laughing, "and new potatoes, and
eggs that were laid this morning, if we want them,
and&mdash;Come, I'll show you what we have, and we'll
make a picnic feast."</p>

<p>She turned away and led the big man towards the
step of the wagon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
"My name is Smith," the big man asserted with an
effort as he followed her.</p>

<p>"How stupid of me!" Augusta apologized from the
step of the wagon. "But, out gypsying like this, it's so
easy to get careless in one's manners. We are the Wardwells.
My husband is a writer," she catalogued carefully.
"And I am his wife. And our horse Donahue once
lived under a lake in Ireland."</p>

<p>The big man turned for a look at Donahue. "Them
horses was white," he argued, "I know all about them.
He's a rusty red."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Augusta cheerfully as she dived
into her stores and handed forth potatoes and bacon,
"that's rust, from the dampness."</p>

<p>The big man exploded into a roaring laugh. "God
bless the handy liar that made that up for you! I don't
think you did it yourself."</p>

<p>"No," Augusta admitted, "it's my husband. You see,
inventing is his business. I only quote. And Donahue,
who is truly wise, he only listens."</p>

<p>Jimmie was dutifully unhitching Donahue.</p>

<p>"Donahue," he grumbled as he tugged at the girth
buckle, "<i>what</i> do you know about that?</p>

<p>"Now, not as between master and servant but as
horse to man, give me your plain opinion. Are women
born into the world full armed with all the weapons of
diplomacy, tact and happy deceit? And if they are not
so born, Donahue, I put it to you, who teaches them?</p>

<p>"Augusta is fully convinced that the man is a desperate
criminal. And she waves the whole matter aside,
as though he had merely apologized for being without a
dress suit, and makes him the long lost uncle.</p>

<p>"I am a stupid man and you are not a particularly
brilliant horse. We are stumped, and we know it.</p>

<p>"Come and have a drink."</p>

<p>He led the way down to where there was a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
shingle of pebbles running from the grass bank out
into the lake and Donahue walked into the water so as
to cover all four feet, for he was old and road wise and
he knew the comfort of a cool foot bath after a long
blistering day.</p>

<p>"Good idea," Jimmie commented, "cool your feet
and clear your mind. We need clear minds around here.
Come on now, this is the only lake in the neighborhood.
Don't try to drink it all. You'll spoil your appetite and
ruin your digestion which is already impaired by sugar
bags and other surreptitious gobblings.</p>

<p>"About our Mr. Smith, now," he inquired as he
dragged Donahue away from the water, "what do you
think? What particular branch of high crime does he
favor. He is a specialist, of course. He is far too clever a
man to scatter himself on general practitioning in this
age of specialists. What do you suggest?</p>

<p>"He is a large round man with a kind eye. He could
sell mining stocks. But, somehow, I rather feel that he'd
be above preying on widows and school teachers and
innocent clergymen. I think he'd prefer some excitement
in his.</p>

<p>"He might be a head waiter, of course. But no law
has yet been invented to make those gentlemen flee to
the woods.</p>

<p>"I'll have to give it up, if you have nothing to suggest,"
he concluded lamely.</p>

<p>When he had filled Donahue's measure of oats he
left him feeding at the wagon and came to the fire.</p>

<p>Augusta was hanging a pot of potatoes over the fire
from a long crooked iron hook that was sunk into the
ground. The big man had gone down to the brook where,
it appeared, he had a string of live fish in captivity.</p>

<p>"Do you think we are wise?" said Jimmie cautiously.
"We can't tell, you know. People might be looking for
him. And suppose he had taken things and brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
them here. And if we were found here," he worried on,
"why, we simply haven't any credentials at all. And
we're a deuce of a long ways from anybody that knows
us. It might be very mean for you&mdash;these country
sheriffs, you know, they might bundle the whole of us
off to the nearest county jail, wherever it is."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Augusta warmly, flushing over
the fire. "Just look at the man. I <i>know</i> he didn't do
anything really wrong."</p>

<p>"That's the woman of it," Jimmie argued meanly,
"just because a man looks like a well preserved and
benevolent Greek god and talks with a soft brogue, then
the law of the land must be wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, the law <i>is</i> wrong lots of times," Augusta
answered evenly. And Jimmie wondered whether
women, with all the terrible discipline which nature
and human society put upon them, were not essentially
more lawless than men; or was it that they had gotten
a larger share of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge and
actually did know good from evil.</p>

<p>He had no time for any remarks on the subject, for
the big man was coming back from the brook carrying
a big fish, cleaned and split, on a toaster that was
fashioned out of two bent pieces of wire.</p>

<p>"If ye'll just rub in the salt," he said, holding out
the fish to Augusta. "It'll not need a deal of it for we'll
lash the bacon in with the fish."</p>

<p>"Our table is very little," said Augusta, regarding
her folding table as she took the salt from it. "But you
and Jimmie can sit and I'll wait on you like an Indian
woman."</p>

<p>For some reason Augusta was supremely happy. It
was not merely the exciting effect of the feeling that she
was flouting the law. And she was deeply touched by
the big man's plight as she understood it. But there was
about her to-night what Jimmie sometimes called a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
mist of happiness, as though she trod on dew rays and
moved in a cloud.</p>

<p>"Faith'n I know a trick worth two o' that," said the
big man positively. "If you'll just turn the fish against
the fire, mam&mdash;not over the fire, mind you, but just
against it&mdash;I'll find a table."</p>

<p>He disappeared into the darkness of the little house,
and presently came out carrying a good sized table.</p>

<p>"McQuade's a queer duck enough. But I'll say for
him that he does keep his things clean."</p>

<p>"Who's McQuade?" Jimmie inquired with a show of
interest. He was nervous. He did not like the position
at all. He was, in fact, out of his element. He was a man
of city streets, where certain people are paid to take
care of every sort of situation. Here he would not know
what to do. This man was, beyond doubt, a criminal at
large. It was entirely possible that a posse was even at
this moment searching the vicinity for him. He would
certainly have fire arms about. Wardwell shuddered as
he thought of Augusta being senselessly exposed in a
desperate affair of this kind. But, since Augusta had
set the tone for the party, there was nothing for him to
do but to follow her lead as best he could.</p>

<p>"McQuade's a nut," said the big man, placing the
table judiciously under a tree to windward of the fire.
"He owns this place. He has a fine farm fifty miles down
the Parishville road. He has plenty to do, and everything
to do it with. And he has a grand energetic
Yankee wife to see that he does it. But, an' there's the
thrapin' contrary Irish of him, he'd far rather come up
here an' sit on the step o' the door an' look out at the
lake than to put in the finest harvest that ever was."</p>

<p>"I think he's just right," Augusta argued, glad that a
neutral subject had been introduced. For even she, in
the heating test of holding the baking fish to the fire and
watching the boiling potatoes, was not sure how long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
their thoughts and conversation could be kept away
from forbidden ground. There were so many things
which it would be unfortunate to mention to a strayed
criminal.</p>

<p>"'John McQuade o' the sunny shade an' the woodbine
cottage' he calls himself, and he thinks, because
he'd a long sight rather loaf and fish than work his
honest farm, that he must surely be some sort of a
character. I'm not sure but he half thinks he's a poet,
or at the very least a philosopher. In five minutes he
can give you more good reasons for vagabondin' than
you could argue down in a long day's talk."</p>

<p>"This must be a man worth knowing," said Jimmie.</p>

<p>"He's jealous right away!" Augusta laughed. "He's
afraid that somebody's been discovered who can talk
more nonsense than he can."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said the big man sententiously as he
picked the potato pot off the fire and turned to drain
off the water, "nonsense is the salt o' creation. The
maxims of the unwise," he pronounced, hanging the
pot back over the fire again, to dry for a moment, "are
the gatherings of fools' experience. But, ye'll mind,
the fools get far more experience than the wise folk.
So, there you are."</p>

<p>He brought the potatoes from the fire and deftly
turned them into the dish that Augusta had waiting.
Augusta brought the baked fish, and he showed her
how to slip it from the toaster, without disturbing the
bacon which was cooked right into the fish.</p>

<p>Jimmie, seeing the dusk which seemed to be gathering
in upon them from the shadows of the trees, brought
the lantern from the wagon and was going to hang it
lighted from a tree. But the big man would not hear
of this. He would have no smelly lanterns around a
sylvan feast, he said. And since he was seconded by
Augusta he had his way. From under the house he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
dragged out a fire cradle, a wire basket on the end of an
iron rod, which is used in the prow of a boat for spearing
fish at night. This he drove fast into the top of a
stump and filled it with knots of resinous wood.</p>

<p>The strong reddish light had the effect of drawing
the darkness down upon them immediately, so that
they could not see a thing beyond the radius of its
rays. It gave them a feeling of complete isolation from
all the world, such as only a campfire at night can
give, and, in a way, a sense of security. But Wardwell
could not help thinking, and only with difficulty refrained
from saying, that it was a foolish thing for a
hunted man to so advertise his whereabouts with a
light that could attract attention for miles in the hills.</p>

<p>The big Irishman, however, seemed the most unworried
fugitive at large.</p>

<p>"No," he declared, as though continuing an argument,
"you couldn't do a thing in the world better
than to stop right here till the snow flies." It was plain
that Augusta had talked plans with him while Jimmie
and Donahue were down at the lake. "Or if there is
one thing better it'd be to stop right here through the
winter."</p>

<p>"But, Lord Alive man!" said Jimmie, appalled at
the idea, "we'd freeze to death! You don't know, and
I don't want to know, what the cold is like here."</p>

<p>"I know it well. But I never knew anybody yet
that froze to death in it."</p>

<p>"Yes, but we're city folks," Jimmie argued. "We
wouldn't know how to keep ourselves alive. Don't forget
that we've been brought up to hug radiators."</p>

<p>"An' that's the very thing that you must forget.
The way to keep warm is not to get cold. Get an ax,
there's a good one inside there, and go at the windfall
wood here. Agen the time comes when ye'll want the
wood for big rousing fires ye'll have a fire up inside of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
you shootin blood through your veins in a way that'll
let you laugh at cold."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that I'd have the nerve to try it,"
said Jimmie doubtfully. "But even if I had there are
two things that seem to be objections."</p>

<p>"What two things?"</p>

<p>"Well, first, there's&mdash;my wife," Jimmie explained
a little stiffly, "she couldn't chop wood, so she'd just
naturally have to freeze."</p>

<p>"Leave it to a woman to face any dare," said the
big man easily. "She'll come through and laugh, when
you'll be fit to cry."</p>

<p>"I know that," Jimmie admitted. "But, besides,
there's Mr. McQuade to be thought of. He hasn't yet
given us any invitation to move into his camp and
use his ax."</p>

<p>"Be easy, then," said the big man promptly. "I'll
give me word for McQuade. He'll never miss any bit
you use. And I'll warrant that he'll be only too glad to
have someone gettin' good o' the camp. There's the
big sugar house itself stuck in the hill back of us. The
boilin' pans are out and the brick furnace is topped
over with sheet iron. The very thing. When the real
cold comes ye'll just move in there an' lay your open
fire in the very door o' the furnace, an' there ye have
a camp snug an' dry an' as warm as ever ye'll want
to make it. An' there's full an' plenty of blankets there
stowed away for the boys."</p>

<p>He went on expatiating at large and generously on
the resources of the sugar cabin, while Augusta listened
eagerly and dreamed of the snowbound winter
nights with the big fire blazing. Jimmie with his eye
fixed firmly on his plate was fighting back a grin. If
he could have had Donahue's ear for a moment he
would have pointed out to him that this making so
free of other people's property was good philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
but that it was rather discouraged by the laws of the
state.</p>

<p>He did not, however, say any of these things, for,
in spite of all, he found himself liking the big man,
it was impossible to do otherwise, and Jimmie would
have felt it a very ugly thing indeed to have hurt him
by any smart reference to his unfortunate position.</p>

<p>"You'll need to get rid of the horse," the big man
was advising Augusta, who, it seemed, was already in
charge of the practical operations for the winter.</p>

<p>"Horse?" said Augusta vaguely. She was utterly
unable to grasp the idea.</p>

<p>"Your horse, yes. It'd take all he's worth to feed
him through the winter, and he'd be no use to you at
all. In the spring you can buy another if you're wantin'
one."</p>

<p>"But you mean&mdash;You mean <i>sell Donahue</i>!"</p>

<p>"Who else?" said the big man unconcernedly.</p>

<p>"Never, never! You don't understand at all. Why,
Donahue is one of ourselves! We could never think
of such a thing." And Augusta looked her indignation
at Jimmie, as though he had offered the proposal.</p>

<p>"I suppose it would be the practical thing to do,"
said Jimmie without thinking. "But, of course, we
needn't think of it. We haven't come that far yet, you
know."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think we <i>will</i> think of it," Augusta
returned warmly. "I don't see how you can suggest
such a thing, Jimmie, when you know well enough
we wouldn't be here at all if Donahue hadn't pulled
us every step of the way!"</p>

<p>"Oh well, mam," the big man put in softly, "you
see I was only saying what I'd do meself. You'll do
whatever you think best, of course. But for your
husband, now, as I was saying," he switched skillfully
back to safe ground, "put the ax in his hand, an' don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
let him hurt himself with it at first, an' agen the snow
flies you'll see him a man as hard as nails an' twice as
important, for, say what you will about the pride of
brains, there's nothing that makes a man quite so sure
proud of himself as to feel the strength bulgin' up in
him."</p>

<p>Supper over, the two men helped Augusta with
the dishes while the big Irishman dealt out sage counsels
to provide for every emergency that might confront
the two people who were to stay on here. He seemed
to leave no room at all for doubt that they would stay.
He refused to hear that they had no right to stay here
and use Mr. McQuade's property. In the first place,
he argued that McQuade was a rich old curmudgeon
who would never know how much or how little of his
property they might use. And in the next breath he
represented McQuade to be a man of a heart of gold
who would gladly move out of his own house and home
to leave it to some one who had more need of it.</p>

<p>Jimmie reflected that the arguments were hopelessly
contradictory, but as the whole manner of their evening's
entertainment had been fantastic and more or
less unbelievable he decided to leave study and decision
over until the morning.</p>

<p>Augusta was not looking for logic. She had fallen
under the spell of the big man's promises for Jimmie's
health and she was willing to take Mr. McQuade's
complacence for granted.</p>

<p>When they had settled down about the fire and the
early evening noises of the woods were dying down
to the occasional, lonely cheepings of a restless bird
or the far distant, creepy baying of a hound somewhere
in the hills, the talk became fitful and desultory.</p>

<p>Jimmie was keenly sorry for the big breezy man who
was so cheerfully proposing to leave this place which
apparently had been a safe haven and take the lonely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
hopeless trail of a hunted man. And Augusta, always
sensitive to Jimmie's moods and thoughts, was depressed
and nervous with him. Every happy start of
conversation which they tried to make seemed inevitably
to turn back to something which must be avoided.
They could not ask where "Mr. Smith" intended going,
or hope that they might see him soon again, or even
offer him provisions out of their own store, without
bringing themselves upon the dismal question of what
he had done and why he was "wanted."</p>

<p>"Can you shoot?" the big man asked in one of the
pauses.</p>

<p>"I can hit things in a gallery, but I never hunted
much," Jimmie explained.</p>

<p>"It's not the same thing at all. But if you've the
eyes and the nerve you'll very soon learn. And you'll
be wanting fresh meat. There'll be plenty of it hereabout
in another month, birds and rabbits and later
on deer. Get a good rifle and learn the times for shooting.
Have your license right and see that you keep the law.
You might think you wouldn't be bothered here. But
the game people would spot you out in no time, and
you being a stranger with a gypsy wagon you'd get
no shrift at all." Jimmie commented to himself on the
stranger's respect for what he himself in common with
most people had always thought of as merely a formal
law.</p>

<p>"You'll want to hunt, to kill things," the big man
stated. "I don't know why it is, but it's a fact. No
sooner does a man feel his own life and strength swellin'
up in him than rightabout he wants to kill things. And,
would you believe it, he thrives on it. Killing, do you
know, is one of the healthiest occupations&mdash;"</p>

<p>A startling, ear-splitting noise broke out of the
silence of the night and moved towards them with
frightening rapidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Wardwell sprang to his feet and placed himself in
front of Augusta. He did not know what he expected
to see come driving upon them out of the dark. But
the noise, to his city ears, had just one meaning. It
was a sharp, staccato, drumming sound on a rising
note, and it was apparently coming straight at them.
In a way, Wardwell might be said to have been prepared
for this. The noise, as he understood it, was quite
familiar to him. He was certain that a badly firing
motorcycle had been started just a little way off and
was now dashing straight for their fire. He quite forgot
the trees and rocks, for he could not see them, and
stood peering defiantly out into the darkness that
fell black and formless beyond the circle of the flare of
light. He was convinced that a motorcycle policeman
was bearing down upon them. But his only emotion
seemed to be indignation at the fellow for driving
without a light.</p>

<p>Around to the right another drumming, driving
sound broke out and beat and purred upon the same
note as the first. This sound also came toward them.</p>

<p>"Surrounded!" said Jimmie bravely, reaching back
for Augusta's hand to pull her closer to him&mdash;one could
never tell, there might be shooting here.</p>

<p>Augusta had risen and was standing right behind
Jimmie. She did not understand, but she was frightened
because Jimmie seemed to know what the danger
was and would not tell her.</p>

<p>The whole action was a matter of seconds. Jimmie
turned for a quick look at the big man whose doom
was coming thus swiftly upon him. He sat on the
stump where they had first seen him, his hands clutching
tightly at his knees, his big face red in the glare of
the light and plainly working with some strong emotion.</p>

<p>The noise ceased suddenly as the two partridges
who had made it got wing in air at last and came flying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
over the fire. It took Jimmie some time to believe that
these birds, beating with their wide bare wings like
flat boards on the ground and underbrush as they ran
along the ground until they had momentum enough
to take the air, had caused all that noise. But when he
did realize it and turned to try to explain to Augusta,
he felt extremely foolish.</p>

<p>The big man did not wait for the explanation. He
rose hastily from the stump and lurched toward the
house, saying in a choking voice:</p>

<p>"I'm goin' in."</p>

<p>Jimmie's explanation, while he took down the flare
light and buried the flaming knots in the ashes of the
fire, was entirely true and fairly accurate. But it was
wasted. Augusta was convinced that someone was
trying to hide something from her. She listened patiently,
but she had her own argument, which she kept
to herself. Jimmie <i>might</i> have been fooled that way
by two birds. <i>But</i>, the other man had been visibly
affected, too!</p>

<p>When Jimmie thought she was settled in her hammock
for the night, he was surprised to hear her rustle
out again and come to his side.</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you think he can have done?" she worried
as she cuddled down to his pillow. "And isn't there
anything we can do for him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be troubled, dear. He'll probably be
able to take care of himself. I don't hardly think he's
done anything himself. Maybe he's just keeping out
of the way from something. You know there's always
an investigation or some blamed thing going on. Maybe
it's only that," he suggested reassuringly. "Get into
bed and sleep. You're tired to death."</p>

<p>Augusta gave him a hit-or-miss kiss in the dark,
climbed into her bed and went obediently to sleep
like a child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Jimmie listened gratefully to the gentle, even breathing
that told him that she had forgotten everything.
There was a curious feeling of worry upon him. The
alarm which he had gotten from the strange noise had
turned out ridiculously, of course, but the possibilities
which his imagination had seen in it stayed about, to
suggest new pictures of trouble and possible danger
for Augusta.</p>

<p>He fell asleep, heartily wishing that they had never
seen this man, whoever he was.</p>

<p>He awoke in the bright morning light, to find Augusta
standing over him, fully dressed, shaking him
with one hand and with the other waving a bit of
paper accusingly at him.</p>

<p>"He's gone! He's gone, I tell you!" she was crying
at Jimmie, as though he had spirited the big man
away in the dark.</p>

<p>Jimmie sat up like a jacknife.</p>

<p>"Is the family silver safe?" he inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>"Stop your nonsense and listen." Augusta gave
him another excited shake. "I tell you he's a fraud and
a cheater. I said double prayers for him last night,
and he isn't any criminal at all! I could be angry at
him!"</p>

<p>Now at any other time Jimmie would have gleefully
picked flaws in this bit of Augusta's theology. Instead
he took the paper quite humbly and read:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="p2">"Dear Nice Folks, whoever you are:</p>

<p>"It was a shame of me to take you in like that. But
I couldn't help it. It was the suspicious way you looked
at me." (Jimmie took this as directed to himself alone.)</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> wanted. The wife wants me home to start
the harvest. That was in my mind when I said the thing
first. And I kept it up because I wanted to see what'd
happen.</p>

<p>"But you will not be angry, I hope. This place is
yours in welcome if you care to stay. I'll be up to
see you in the Fall.</p>

<p class="p0 bm2 sigright">
John McQuade o' the Sunny Shade."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jimmie laid the paper down on his bunk and looked
at it solemnly and stupidly. After a little he said softly:</p>

<p>"Yes, John, you did everlastingly put one over on
me."</p>

<p>Augusta broke all her rules as she announced gravely:</p>

<p>"He had us kidded to death." Then she dropped
laughing into Jimmie's arms.</p>

<p>"Augusta," Jimmie howled, between spasms of
laughing, "do you remember how I stood nobly in
the dense forest while the gatling guns were charging
down upon us and announced in a dying whisper:</p>

<p>"'Surrounded!'"</p>

<p>"And I," Augusta cried through tears of laughing,
"I was behind your back all the time motioning the
man to take Donahue and fly for liberty!"</p>

<p>"It's a good thing we're married to each other,"
roared Jimmie. "It'd be a pity to spoil two houses
with us."</p>

<p>Augusta got up suddenly. She had made a discovery.</p>

<p>"Do you know," she inquired indignantly, "why
that man went away from the fire so suddenly like
that. He went away some place to laugh at us!"</p>

<p>"He's laughing yet," said Wardwell, and he went
off into another roar. "But, we'll be game, dear. We
won't run away. We'll stay right here till John McQuade
comes back and has his laugh out."</p>

<p>Augusta went out of the wagon and Jimmie began
to dress. With one shoe on and the other in his hand
he thought of something. He pulled the curtain of the
wagon door about him and called Augusta in a bated
whisper.</p>

<p>"For heavens' sake," he appealed, "don't let Donahue
hear of this! I never could face him."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<p>Jimmie was coming down through the woods in
triumph. All day he had tramped and hunted over the
crests of the hills and he was returning with the spoil.
His rifle was slung with just a little angle of careless
swagger across the crook of his arm and from the same
arm hung two pairs of fat partridges. He knew a great
deal more now about partridges than he had known
that night, weeks ago, when two of them had given him
such a start.</p>

<p>He knew, in fact, a great deal more about many
things than he had known that night. And he was a
vastly different man. He was still thin, but it was not
the pale thinness of before. He was lean and brown, his
frame was filling slowly but evenly, and his one care was
the procuring of food. For he had the perpetual hunger
of the gaunt young animal whose growing cells are ever
demanding more and more building materials.</p>

<p>His step had none of the nervous hurry of those who
tread city streets. In his rough tramping boots he
swung down through brush and over rocks with a long,
sure, loping stride which showed that he had forgotten
that he had such things as nerves, and though he was
physically tired his face shone with the zest of a boy
in the game and of the hunter hurrying to his mate with
the kill.</p>

<p>As he came down behind the long sugar house he
heard Augusta singing. She sang a wonderfully sweet
natural contralto, but Jimmie had learned that she
hardly ever sang except when she felt lonely&mdash;and he
knew that there must be times when she was indeed very
lonesome, for this was a life which might well have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
tested the constant cheerfulness of a staid woman, while
Augusta was indeed, in many things, only a highly
sensitive and impressionable child. He started to hurry,
thinking of the many long hours he left her alone in this
lonesome place. But the song arrested him&mdash;he had not
heard it before&mdash;and he loitered a little, not wishing to
break in until he had heard it through.</p>

<p>She was singing:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gyp, Gyp, me little horse?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Gyp-Gyp</i>, again sir."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How many miles to Dublin?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Four score an' ten, sir."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gyp, Gyp, me little horse?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Gyp-Gyp</i>, again sir."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Can I get there by candle-light?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Troth an' back again, sir."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gallopy, gallopy, gallopy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Trot!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I sold my buttermilk every drop.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Ev-er-y</i> drop."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was a happy lilting little song that trotted merrily
up and down an easy range of sweet and saucy notes,
and Jimmie could see "Me Little Horse" dancing
blithely along in front of a cart and answering back his
part of the dialogue. From the song he knew that
Augusta was not singing this time because she was
lonely. She was happy. And it followed, therefore, that
she was busy at something that her heart was proud of.
Jimmie wondered if she had, perhaps, found some new
and wonderfully neater way of turning a patch on his
clothes. This he had found was one of Augusta's most
thrilling and soul satisfying achievements. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
was another sound that came hammering into the
song as he came nearer. It was a jerky, clicking, amateurish
sort of noise, but it was unmistakable. Jimmie's
head went up and one ear turned up into the air, listening
with unbelief. But there came the stroke of the
little bell near the end of the line, and he plainly heard
the sound of the carriage being shifted.</p>

<p>"By the Poker of Moses!" said Jimmie to himself.
"She's found a typewriter growing under a toadstool
somewhere, and she's at it. It won't surprise me if she's
got a couple of books written by now. I <i>knew</i> she'd get
loose sometime."</p>

<p>Sure enough, as he came softly around the corner of
the camp house in which they were living, there sat
Augusta in front of John McQuade's table, and,
strangest of all, she was working on Jimmie's own old
machine! The sight of that battered old machine
brought Wardwell up stock still with a lump in his
throat, for he went back on the instant to a black night,
now long ago, when he had laid down such things as
work and ambition and courage, and thought that he
was done with them forever.</p>

<p>Augusta felt him standing there, though he had made
no sound. She turned, laughing.</p>

<p>"I didn't want you to catch me yet," she confessed.
"But, I don't care. I can do some whole lines without a
mistake. And I just got pounding away at that old
song&mdash;my Daddy used to trot me on his foot to it&mdash;and
I was so happy that I didn't care whether you came or
not."</p>

<p>"I'll smash the old fraud," said Jimmie looking with
pretended savagery at the machine that he loved,
"if it makes you feel that way about me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean that way at all! Of course I
wanted you to come every minute."</p>

<p>"But, how did the blamed thing get here?" Jimmie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
growled, still hunting for a pretended grievance. "It
wasn't in the wagon."</p>

<p>"It was! It was!" shouted Augusta jumping up in
glee. "Remember how you jeered at my hat box, the
day we moved from the wagon into the house. When I
wouldn't let you touch it, or let you see me move it, you
swore that I had another man hidden in it. You said
you'd get a divorce."</p>

<p>"But, honestly," she said, coming to lay her hand
on his arm, "didn't you miss it, sometimes? I think I've
seen you walking around at times and looking through
your pockets."</p>

<p>Jimmie laughed. He remembered his nervous trick,
when something was wanting to him, of walking about
and rummaging unconsciously through one pocket after
another.</p>

<p>"People that live in glass houses, shouldn't come home
to roost&mdash;at least not near you, Augusta. I'm getting
afraid of you. You see through me too completely."</p>

<p>"And you know I cleaned out your room at the last
moment. I saved and brought every last scrap of your
book, even the things that you had thrown away. If
you're good, some day, when you've gotten thoroughly
sick and tired of chopping wood and hunting, and when
I've had some more practice, I'll let you have it all.
And then you can start it again, dictating to me. I'll
never let you sit over a typewriter again. I'm sure it was
that sitting stooped over, and fretting, that made all
your trouble before."</p>

<p>At last Jimmie understood the whole significance of
the scheme. Augusta, serene and sure in her beautiful
faith, had held the breaking bridges of life for him, and,
while he had been weakly content to drift down into
the depths of unhoping uselessness, she had looked
calmly and surely ahead and had already seen him
safely across and moving up the heights beyond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Once he had loved Augusta as a big brother adores
and guards a little sister. Again, in another time, their
positions had become reversed and he had loved her
and leaned upon her and taken strength from her,
almost as a child takes strength from a fondling mother.
Now in the light of the nobler, mating partnership that
he began to understand, he was conscious of another and
more wonderful love.</p>

<p>His gun and his game slid quietly to the ground and
he took her gently into his arms with a new light of
adoring tenderness in his eyes.</p>

<p>When they came, however, to putting Augusta's
plans into actual operation Jimmie had his misgivings.
He knew himself. And he knew that, with all of his
ready tongue and his genial effrontery in talking himself
into and out of a situation, he was at bottom shy
and diffident. He had never been able to do good,
sincere work with anybody watching him. He had
always loved to hug and hide his work until it was
actually in print. He had never in his life been guilty of
reading or even showing a manuscript to a friend. And
he was shy now, even of Augusta's quick sympathy and
understanding.</p>

<p>What was worse, he found that his mind was sluggish
and lazy. After the months, in which he had thought
only of rest and sleep and the feeding of his body, he
found it almost impossible to spur his mind up to the
point of nervous tension where he could create with any
sequence. The fires of his brain were banked and choked
with the accumulations which the greedy body was
piling up for itself. He felt stupid, and yet he found that
he could not even get irritated with himself over the
fact.</p>

<p>To please Augusta, he kept on trying, for he knew
how she must have set her heart on this plan of hers
and he would have given everything that was in him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
make it a success. Never in his life had he tried so
hard and so consciously to write good lines. But the
good lines would not come, even though he sat for hours
dictating painfully and slowly while Augusta wrote.
He knew that the work was not good, but he would say
nothing, secretly hoping that she would soon tire of
the drudgery and let him get at the machine, as he was
now hungry to do, in his own way.</p>

<p>Augusta did not tire. But in the end she pronounced
fatal judgment. One day in the middle of a long paragraph
she dropped her hands from the keyboard and
looked Jimmie squarely in the eye.</p>

<p>"Nothing but the truth, Jimmie," she demanded,
"do I get in your way? This is not your good work."</p>

<p>"Had you noticed?" said Jimmie dryly.</p>

<p>"It is not bad," Augusta explained, springing loyally
to the defence of anything that Jimmie had done. "For
anybody else it would be perfectly all right. But it
isn't just you, Jimmie. It's not just alive, you see.
It's&mdash;It's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wooden," said Jimmie shortly and without stress.</p>

<p>Much as she hated to, Augusta let the criticism stand.
She threw the cover over the machine without a word.
That was the end of a dream which Augusta had been
hugging to her heart for months. Now Augusta, as we
know, was a high hearted, high handed little lady, and
she always knew that her way was right. Remembering
this, we may arrive at some idea of what it cost her to
drop, without a whimper, even as she dropped the
cover over the machine, her dearest, deepest laid little
plan, and to say blithely:</p>

<p>"Come on for a run around the lake! Tomorrow you
can have a pad and pencil and sit on the back of your
neck with your feet up in the window and scribble your
own way."</p>

<p>Wardwell knew the cost of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
The next day was rainy and Jimmie was forced to sit
about the house all day. He was still near enough to his
recent sickness to feel peevish and irritable when it
rained, he hated wind and rain. He grudgingly envied
Augusta for the carelessness with which she could run
out into the rain. He noticed that she made wholly
unnecessary trips out to the stable, away beyond the
end of the sugar cabin, to see if Donahue was all right.
Donahue was perfectly all right, Jimmie was sure. He
did not see that lumps of sugar did the old fool any good,
anyhow.</p>

<p>In short, Jimmie was working himself into a thorough
stew of working fever, ripping and tearing viciously at
the work which he and Augusta had been so faithfully
laboring on, and incidentally scrapping down some
very good paragraphs which he knew, with a growl of
satisfaction for each one, would stand the test.</p>

<p>He did not know that Augusta was having a little
cry every time she went to the stable. Neither did he
know that the lumps of sugar, which he denounced as
being wholly unsuited to Donahue's digestion, were in
reality the "thirty pieces of silver," with which, in
Augusta's imagination, Donahue was being betrayed.
So Jimmie could not know that Augusta, too, was
developing a temperament. He was entirely unprepared
for its demonstration.</p>

<p>"Rot!" he grunted, jabbing his pencil through something
he had just written and beginning to write again
furiously, meanwhile trying to sit on his left shoulder
blade in the chair with his feet piled up in the window.</p>

<p>The room was small. The stove was smoking a little.
It was only three o'clock. There were, for Augusta,
interminable hours to be gone through before she could
even pretend to busy herself with getting supper. And
a certain matter was working vividly upon her conscience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
"Shucks!" she remarked. "I could write a book myself
with less fuss, and not lose my temper about it,
either."</p>

<p>"Of course, dear." Jimmie answered dutifully. He
had not the remotest idea of what she had said.</p>

<p>After an interval of alternate cutting and hurried,
excited writing, during which the room might have
been moved out into the rain for all Jimmie would have
known or cared, so long as he was not forcibly disturbed,
it was slowly forced upon his attention that
something was going on in the room. He was aware
while he worked that Augusta had seated herself at
the machine and was clicking away fitfully at it.</p>

<p>That fact in itself would not have been sufficient to
draw his attention. He might well have supposed that
she was merely practicing, to fill in a dull and rainy
afternoon. But there was something dynamic in the
air about Augusta. She clicked nervously and tentatively
at intervals, and then hammered on viciously and
desperately, as though she feared that the thought
would escape her before she had time to nail it down in
words.</p>

<p>Jimmie's jaw dropped and he sat staring at her in
stupid amazement. He could see the delicate lines of her
figure drawn tense and sharp like the body of some very
beautiful animal straining before a leap. He could see
that her whole mind and heart were being thrown
into the words that she was driving down upon the
paper, and it was not merely his loyalty, his faith in
everything that Augusta did, which told him that what
she was doing was fine. He knew that she was creating
something worthy, by the very power that he saw
straining in her effort. She was putting will and soul
and a wonderful, untrammelled native intelligence into
it, and it could be nothing less than good.</p>

<p>He waited excitedly for the end of the page, to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
what she would do. Augusta was orderly above all other
things. Jimmie was making hasty bets with himself as
to whether her little god of order would prevail and
make her take the paper out carefully and look at it
before starting another, as a sane person would do, or
would she throw it down and race on with another
without looking at what she had done. If she did the
latter, then the fever had indeed taken her and she was
lost.</p>

<p>He gave a mental whoop of sympathy as Augusta,
coming with a bang to the end of the sheet, fairly
tore it from the machine and threw it down without
looking to see whether it fell on the table or the floor.
With the same motion of her swift hands she had swept
down upon another sheet of paper and without even
waiting to straighten it had jammed it into the machine
and was banging away for dear life upon the over-lapping
sentence.</p>

<p>"Another good cook and honest citizen lost!" Jimmie
groaned to himself. "Once that fever has bitten her she
won't care which side the fish is burned on." Nevertheless,
with the eagerness and adroitness of a thieving
cat, he stole across the floor and picked up the paper
from where it had fallen, without disturbing Augusta.</p>

<p>He read the page that Augusta had written, without
comment of any kind. Then with a sort of stupid
solemnity he gathered up the pages at which he himself
had been scribbling and examined them gravely, as
though his reading of Augusta's page had put them in an
entirely new light. He laid down his own work on his
knees and beside it he laid the page that Augusta had
written, and read wonderingly from one and from the
other.</p>

<p>In his own work he had gone back to the point where
he had left the story months ago. He had not used a
single one of the ideas which he had so laboriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
dictated to Augusta, but had struck into an entirely
new turn. Augusta could not have known what he was
doing or thinking today. Yet she had taken his idea
just where he had left it and she was carrying it through
the very drift which he had just today thought of.</p>

<p>He reached into an inner pocket for a fountain pen
and examined it carefully. Then he cleared his pad
and began to write slowly and precisely. He was not
now inventing. He was a critic, a just judge, a man having
authority; in short, an editor. He took impartially,
with cold and fearless discrimination, from Augusta's
paper and from his own. And it was an astonishing
fact that he was hardly obliged to add even connectives.
A paragraph of hers fitted in after one of his so neatly
that there was not a seam of divergence between. And
there were even sentences which he could begin in
Augusta's words, and end with his own. He was not now
excited. He was working with the cool and certain precision
of the trained man who has his tools right and is
finding perfect materials ready to his hand.</p>

<p>He did not care where the materials came from. He
had no compunction that Augusta's thoughts were
sacredly her own and that he had no right to use them
so. Neither, on the other hand, did he feel the smallest
resentment when he found himself bound to drop one
of his own best regarded lines and replace it with one
from Augusta's. He cared for nothing but what he
saw was the excellence of the finished product.</p>

<p>When Augusta had finished her second sheet he
rescued it from the floor where it, too, had fallen disregarded,
and went on with his editing.</p>

<p>By the time when Augusta's third and fourth sheets
came from her hurrying fingers he found that she was
reaching far beyond the point to which he had come in
nearly a whole day's work. She was going, straight and
true, with far less words than he had found necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
swiftly towards the conclusion for which he had been
merely groping. Now he was really put to it to keep his
pace with Augusta's flying thought, to anticipate the
hurrying turn of her fancy, to drive in with the thrust
of his own quick, excited words.</p>

<p>It was a crazy, disorderly method of work, but Jimmie
knew that they were both working on the very edge of
inspiration and he knew that it was all good. For two
solid hours they worked madly, Augusta all unconscious
of the fact that she was taking part in a desperate
race. Finally Jimmie saw that she was trembling with
fatigue and strain.</p>

<p>He went over quickly and swooped her up bodily
into his arms and carried her, protesting, over to his
chair. When he had brought cold water and bathed her
forehead and eyes, for he knew how they must be
smarting and dancing with fever and strain, he said:</p>

<p>"Rest a little, dear; and then I am going to show you
something."</p>

<p>"Have you been looking at what I did?" she asked
quickly, seeing her pages where he had laid them.</p>

<p>"I have, Augusta, and they're great. And on top of
that I've taken the most impudent liberty. But you
shall be judge."</p>

<p>"Why? What have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"Well, read this first, will you please, dear," he
evaded, giving her the stuff that he himself had scribbled
at all day.</p>

<p>"But, it's just like," she said, when half way through
it. "I had no idea what you were thinking of."</p>

<p>"I know you didn't," said Jimmie with a grin. "I
didn't myself. Now read your own."</p>

<p>She glanced eagerly over it, and for a moment
Jimmie was sorry, sorry that the will to write had come
to her. For Augusta would be a terrible critic upon
herself. Immediately he saw the frown of the artist's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
discontent with her work clouding her face. Augusta
was too clever not to see the raw and badly tooled
places in her own work just as she saw them in his
work. And Jimmie thought of several men whom he
knew, fairly successful as writers, too, who never knew
this discontent, who could sit down and gloat over
everything they wrote, fatuously thinking it all good
merely because it was theirs. Augusta had gone farther
in this afternoon than those men had progressed in
years. He counted the cost for her and knew what she
would suffer from her own sensitive and merciless
judgment. Nevertheless, he knew, with a sort of helpless
fatalism, that he would not now try to stop her.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, handing her the finished product
which he had made from her work and his, "here is the
impudence. It's for you to tear it up or let it stand."</p>

<p>She took it without a question and began to read
carefully, while Jimmie stood by waiting for the verdict.
He felt that Augusta had every right to be hurt
by his ruthlessly grabbing and mutilating to his own
purposes her first little heart-wrung work. But he soon
saw from her hurrying breath and shining eyes that
he had not done wrong.</p>

<p>At the end, she jumped up and hugged him, crying:</p>

<p>"It's fine, Jimmie! And it's yours and mine! <i>Ours!</i>"</p>

<p>After a little Jimmie said:</p>

<p>"Yes, the spiteful relatives may say that it has its
great uncle's red hair and that they can't imagine
where it gets its good looks from anyway, but it's
<i>ours</i>."</p>

<p>Augusta hid her face in the general region of Jimmie's
vest pocket, and when she finally looked up the change
of subject was complete.</p>

<p>"I'll have to sell Donahue," she said quietly. And her
face was set and steady, as though she had been thinking
of nothing but this decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Now here Jimmie failed. He should have been ready
with argument, balderdash, or discussion of some sort.
He knew that Augusta would rather sell her last pair
of shoes than sell Donahue. But he was curiously and
fatally tongue-tied. He had never, since they had
started out upon the road, been able to speak of money
with Augusta. He had not at any time formed the
slightest idea as to how much, or how little, she might
have on which to go through with this venture on which
she had staked everything. And he knew, a little
guiltily, that it was not altogether delicacy that kept
him from asking out and facing the details with her.</p>

<p>He was ashamedly conscious of a little lingering,
subtle, unworthy resentment of the way that he had
been bundled into this thing without being consulted.
And, perhaps because he knew that it was altogether
wrong and base, he could not speak, but had gone on
weakly leaving all thought and worry upon Augusta.
It would have been a simple matter, and he knew it,
to have asked her just how real was the need of money.
But he could not, or would not, do it.</p>

<p>When he did not answer, Augusta explained.</p>

<p>"We cannot afford to buy feed for him through the
winter," she stated, with a matter-of-fact coolness
which did not at all deceive Jimmie. "And neither he
nor the wagon would be of any use to us in the deep
snow."</p>

<p>"But, isn't there some other way? Couldn't I rake up
some old stories, or something?"</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>" And Augusta stamped her foot. "I wouldn't
have you stop a minute from the book now for anything
in the world."</p>

<p>That was the end of the discussion.</p>

<p>That afternoon was the beginning of a new and bewildering
life for the two of them. Jimmie did honestly
try to limit the amount of Augusta's work. But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
soon recognized the uselessness of the attempt. She
worked furiously when the work came to her, writing
pages sometimes while he sweated and growled over a
few scratched lines. They were both madly happy,
asking nothing of life, or of the world; caring not a
thought for the success that might come to them.</p>

<p>They never talked over the work that lay ahead.
They did no concerted planning. Each of them began a
chapter in his or her own way, without the slightest
thought of how or where that chapter was to end. They
were independent of plans, these two; for out of their
own lives they had learned that the spinning wheel of
truth takes no account of plans. One could only start,
and keep on to see what the next turning would bring.
So it was with the story that came turning swiftly out
of their imaginations. It ran its own way with each of
them, rushing along smoothly, stumbling, stopping,
flashing on again.</p>

<p>Then at intervals Jimmie would stop and take just
and unswerving measure of what they had done. At the
first, in building the finished story out of the materials
which they both had furnished, Jimmie had tried to
make Augusta sit in judgment with him, had tried to
consult with her as to what should go in and what
should be left out. But Augusta would have none of this
office. Jimmie was trained in the craft, and he must
take the responsibility of selection and rejection. That
was the way she put it. And Jimmie answered:</p>

<p>"You're a bigger man than I am, Augusta. Without
at least a howl, I couldn't let William Shakespeare&mdash;and
he's had time to learn some things, if he's been
reading the things the critics say about his work&mdash;but
I couldn't let even him maul my stuff the way I do
yours."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> wouldn't let William Shakespeare do it,
either." And Jimmie answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
"Oh."</p>

<p>So Augusta copied, faithfully and without comment
or question, the story as Jimmie edited it.</p>

<p>In this time they were curiously detached and
tolerant. They did not demand so much of each other.
And, though neither of them would have admitted it,
this was a relief. They were very far from being tired of
each other. But, it is humanly impossible for two normal,
independent willed people to live through the
hours of every day and night for months in the exclusive
society of each other without feeling a strain. Good
nature, good sense, and even gentle, thoughtful love
will fail sometime. And two people are, after all, just
two human beings.</p>

<p>Now, when the mind of each of them was busy
during waking hours with the doings of other people
whom it was creating and trying to manage, Jimmie and
Augusta each found that the other was delightfully
easy to get along with. They came and went, worked or
played, and Jimmie hunted and Augusta fished, when
Jimmie wanted to hunt and when Augusta wanted to
fish. Which arrangement they found to be immeasurably
better, after all, than the one in which each had
been laboriously trying to do only the things that the
other wanted.</p>

<p>Jimmie had not forgotten that the problem of
Donahue was before them. Augusta had spoken of it
only that once, but he knew that she felt bound to
sell the horse and that neither argument nor heart-break
would deter her from what she conceived to be
duty. He had, however, a hope&mdash;which he did not mention&mdash;that
perhaps Augusta would not be able to sell
Donahue, for any amount that would be worth considering,
and that, finally, she would allow him to try
to get some money out of scraps of stories. He was
sure that he could hatch up some fairly good ones now.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
So he said nothing, and waited. For them, and for
what they had needed, Donahue was the ideal horse.
There was none to equal him. But as an article of
commerce in the open and unprejudiced market Jimmie
did not believe that Donahue would bring very much
money. It was probable that most of the farmers in
the hills had already more cattle and horses than they
cared to feed through the winter. And it did not seem
likely that any of them would pay a high price for the
privilege of feeding Donahue through five or six months
of idleness.</p>

<p>Of course, he underestimated Augusta's perseverance
and business force.</p>

<p>On a gray October morning when there was already
a threat of snow in the air Jimmie went rabbit hunting
over the bowl of hills that encircled their little lake.
He took no lunch, for he intended to be home before
midday. But rabbits are not to be depended on in any
weather. Besides, Jimmie followed a fox for two useless,
scrambling hours. Therefore it was the middle of the
short afternoon when Jimmie came home. The one
big bare room which was the house they lived in, and
which Augusta's warming, coloring personality alone
had made into a home, was cold and dreary even after
the brown bleakness of the hills. The fire must have
been out for hours. Jimmie was tired and hungry, and
he missed Augusta discontentedly.</p>

<p>Where could she have gone for all this time? She
would not be fishing. It was too cold to sit holding a
pole. Then where could she be, and why?</p>

<p>He lighted the fire and thought of cooking some
bacon. But even the warmth of the fire did not drive
away his discontent about Augusta. Suddenly he did
not care for bacon. He put it back, and, just to prove
that he was miserable, he beat up a bowl of the hated
milk and eggs and forced himself to drink it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
He went out to the barn to see Donahue. The horse
was not there. Augusta must have hitched up and
gone down to Jethniah Gamblin's for provisions.
Strange that she should not have told him. He had
not heard that they were needing things. He went
around to the shed, for confirmation of the obvious.
Yes, the wagon was gone.</p>

<p>The utter desolation of the place fell upon him like
a physical chill. Everything that was his was gone.
He felt depressed and deserted. And there came upon
him a cold foreboding that some day, through his own
fault, Augusta would go and leave him thus alone, his
lips dry and cracking with the caking ashes of dreams.</p>

<p>"Hills of Desire!" he growled, looking around in
mockery at the bare trees and the rocky, storm gashed
hillsides.</p>

<p>He got the axe and went at his woodpile, not with
enthusiasm but with hatred. He had some good sized
limbs of trees which had been broken off in a recent
heavy storm, and it would have been less wasteful
and far more easy to have cut them into proper lengths
with a saw. But that would by no means have fitted
the frame of his temper at that time. He wanted to
hack and hew and destroy. And the vicious, swinging
axe spoke his mind, while he grumblingly wondered
what Augusta could be talking to Jethniah Gamblin
about all this time, anyway. And it was a wonder that
that bitter tongued old woman in the window had not
put a stop to it before now.</p>

<p>Several times he dropped the axe to go out through
the fringe of trees to watch for the wagon returning
along the track that came up by the brook. Finally
when the early dusk was beginning to fall, he gave up
the pretense at the wood pile and went out and watched
eagerly and frankly for Augusta. Could anything have
happened to her? In fact, he would long ago have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
started down the track to meet her, but he knew how
Augusta hated even the appearance of being followed.
She had made a point of pride of her independence
and her ability to take care of herself and to do things
in her own way, and he knew it would only hurt her
if he made any show of anxiety. So he waited, watching
and nervously pacing about along the edge of the
trees.</p>

<p>When, at last, she did come into sight over a rise
in the path Jimmie could scarcely recognize her.</p>

<p>There was no wagon, nor did Donahue appear
ambling along intent upon his own thoughts. Instead,
there was just the lonely figure of a little girl, unbelievably
little and pitifully alone in the dusk and the
big stretches of the darkening hills, trudging uncertainly
along a twisting path.</p>

<p>Jimmie could hardly persuade himself that it was
really Augusta, for the little figure walked heavily and
was disguised with an ugly, oddly hanging bundle that
threw it out of all likeness to his Augusta with her
free swinging, high hearted step. Altogether there was
a look of defeat, of heartbreak about the little figure
that caught Wardwell by the throat. For he knew
that it was Augusta. And he guessed at what she had
done and what she was feeling.</p>

<p>He halloed loudly to her and started running down
the path to meet her.</p>

<p>Then Augusta, after she had waved in answer to his
call, did an odd thing. She dropped her pack, which
had been slung front and back over her shoulder, and
went down from the path to the brook. From where
he ran Jimmie could not see her, but he knew what
she was doing. She was washing her face, to hide things.</p>

<p>She was back in the path and had taken up her pack
when Jimmie reached her.</p>

<p>"I sold Donahue," she announced. "I got a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
dollars for him. Of course, I had to <i>give</i> the wagon
away with him. But it would really have been absurd
of us to try to feed him through the winter when he
wouldn't be of any use to us at all."</p>

<p>Her voice was cool and so matter of fact that for
the instant Jimmie wondered. Was it possible that
she did not care? That she really was thinking of the
money? He took the bag of bundles away from her
and stretching his arm about her they fell into step
together. But, for the first time within his memory,
he felt Augusta stiffen away from him.</p>

<p>He was surprised and a little inclined to resent her
coolness. Unaccountably he found himself in a very bad
temper and with no possible excuse for it. If he spoke he
felt certain that they would quarrel and that he would
be wholly and shamefully to blame. He did not speak,
but there was a muttering resentment of something
stirring up in him. It persisted, until he thought of
Augusta as he had seen her coming trudging out of
the dusk like some deserted, forlorn little squaw upon
the trail. Then his natural insight came to him, and
he knew, as well as if he had walked with her, that
Augusta had cried bitterly all the way, and that she
was now hardening herself against his sympathy lest
she should break down and let him see what her day's
work had cost her.</p>

<p>He understood now. And the thought of Augusta
facing the dreary winter here without her pet and
friend made him feel very bitterly the having to accept
the sacrifice from her. Surely Augusta must know how
he appreciated the sacrifice. But he could not tell her.
He could not say a word, for all the time his mind was
biting in upon itself and he was mumbling, "Wouldn't
it be nice now if I were to speak up and say just what's
the simple truth&mdash;'I'm awfully sorry, Augusta, but
of course you had to have the money to feed me all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
winter.' That <i>would</i> sound pretty, and comforting,
wouldn't it!"</p>

<p>Because he was as ignorant of Augusta as all fairly
good men will always be of women, he did not know
that Augusta wanted him to say nothing of the kind.
What she did want him to do was to take her forcibly
in his arms and <i>tell</i> her that he understood all that it
meant to her. Like all men who think quickly and
deeply he did not know the value of the spoken word,
to a woman. He did not know that, while intuition
and understanding are very well within certain limits,
there are certain things which to a woman are never
true until she hears them spoken in so many words.</p>

<p>They walked on in a silence that grew every moment
more painful, until Wardwell knew that he could bear
it no longer. He must say something. At random he
said the very worst thing, naturally.</p>

<p>"I had no idea," he ventured, "that anybody would
be wanting to buy horses at this time of year."</p>

<p>"Nobody did want to buy. Mr. Gamblin was sorry
for me, I guess, and bought him, for speculation, he
said. I'll feel obliged to give back the money if he isn't
able to sell him again."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was Gamblin, was it?" said Jimmie grumpily.
He was not concerned with Augusta's problem in ethics.
He had somebody to blame now, and he was furiously
angry with Jethniah Gamblin. What business had
that old schemer to take Augusta at her word in that
way?</p>

<p>They came to the house in silence and prepared and
ate a meal that was the most cheerless and dreary
that these two had ever eaten together. When it was
over and the things were cleared away Jimmie settled
into his chair by the table lamp, took up pad and pencil
and pretended to believe that he was going to work.</p>

<p>Augusta busied herself for a little while, doing unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
things about the fire, and then stole miserably
away to the little curtained corner where her
hammock hung.</p>

<p>She had started out in the morning with the glow of
sacrifice burning clear and sweet in her heart. And
now it was night, dark night. Her sturdy friend, her
faithful confidante was gone. She had basely sold him
because she was afraid he would eat too much. Men
would pass him from one hard hand to another, and
he would be beaten for the sin of being old. Meanwhile,
she would save lumps of sugar and quarts of oats. And
Jimmie did not care.</p>

<p>The glow of her sacrifice was cold and dead and the
ashes of it were in her hair.</p>

<p>In the morning Jimmie awakened to the fact that
he was alone in the room. He had not heard Augusta
go out. Or was it that she had just this instant gone
and that her going had stirred him out of deep sleep.
He dressed hastily, wondering at his excitement. She
had run out to see Donahue. She often did that the
very first thing in the morning. But there was no
Donahue out there any more, he remembered. And
he hurried still more.</p>

<p>Although there was obviously no reason for her
going to the empty stable, he still expected to find
her there. The door of the stable was shut, but as he
came nearer he heard the sound of singing. It was the
same little song that Augusta was singing that day
when he came home and found her practicing on the
typewriter, but there was another sound mingling with
the song now. It was like nothing but the rythmic,
rapid tapping of little feet upon a bare floor. Could
Augusta be in a mood for singing and dancing after
last night?</p>

<p>Jimmie turned cautious and stole away from the
door of the stable, around to the side where there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
seams in the stable wall. He would not have thought
of spying upon Augusta. But he was worried now.
There was something almost hysterical in the sound
of the merry little song and the patter of the dancing
feet. He knew that she had been deeply hurt last night
and that she had been too quiet about it. And there
had been a time when he was very much afraid of the
effect upon her of any strong suppressed emotion.</p>

<p class="bm0 nostanza">"Gyp, Gyp me little horse?</p>

<p class="p0 nostanza">"<i>Gyp-Gyp</i>, again <span class="locked">sir."&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The song broke freshly upon him as he gained a view
of the interior of the barn. To his eyes, blinking in
the bright morning light, it was almost dark within.
But a single bar of strong sunlight from a little window
right over where Jimmie stood went in and fell directly
upon the little figure of his wife dancing in the middle
of the floor.</p>

<p>The effect was as though she had thought of an
audience and had staged a spotlight on herself as she
sang and danced. But Jimmie knew that she had not
thought of any such thing. Her little face was as white
as a hunted banshee's. Though her feet pattered lightly
as summer raindrops on a roof, yet there was pain in
them; as though she danced upon the grave of something
dear to her. Her song was not loud, but the happy
little lilt in it was a lie. For, to Wardwell who partly
understood and partly guessed, it was nothing but a
wail and a heart-break. And he was dimly aware that
he was not likely, either in this life or anywhere else,
to suffer anything more bitter than those moments
standing there watching and listening.</p>

<p>The dance broke off suddenly, not because it was
finished but because Augusta could no longer keep
up the pretence.</p>

<p>She ran over to Donahue's stall and leaning her
arms on the partition she buried her face in them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
began to cry wildly. But it was only for a moment.
Then she raised her head with a brave, challenging
shake and said steadily:</p>

<p>"That's all. That's the last, Donahue. Jimmie
doesn't care. And I'll never, never let him see how
much I cared!"</p>

<p>Wardwell understood now, to the full.</p>

<p>He knew that he should go to her now and try to
tell her how much he did care. But just then something
sneered within him and laughed at the idea of
his "going to her and mumbling about how much
he cared, and yet accepting her sacrifice all the time."
No, he could not talk to her about it. He must do something
to show that he did care, that could not mawkishly
take this from her. He must get her pet back for
her before he could talk to her. He hurried back into
the house and lighted the fire.</p>

<p>When Augusta came in it was evident that she had
again visited the brook. She was clear eyed and smiling
and her face gave no sign that it had been swept by
anything harsher than the sweet cool breath of the
morning.</p>

<p>"I was down by the brook," she said, truthfully,
"and I saw your fire. From the looks of the smoke,
I thought you were trying to burn the house."</p>

<p>"Where there's smoke there's fire. The more smoke
the more fire," he said cheerfully, opening a window
to let out some of the smoke.</p>

<p>"It doesn't follow," Augusta argued.</p>

<p>"Besides, I'm going hunting."</p>

<p>"Again? Didn't you hunt all day yesterday?"</p>

<p>"No. I followed a fox. It wasn't hunting. It was
gambling. But I've got a system worked out to beat
him. I figured it out during the night that, at the rate
he was going when I saw him last, he will in about
three quarters of an hour from now be just turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
on his first lap around the world. I shall be at the turn
waiting for him."</p>

<p>"I hope he shows a proper sense of his engagements,"
said Augusta politely. "It would be annoying if he
stopped for a drink or anything on the way. But I
wish you had timed the meeting to come off before
you filled the house quite so full of smoke. I like to
smell the tang of wood smoke. But I don't like to eat
it."</p>

<p>They ate a hearty and a cheerful breakfast, and
Jimmie prepared for instant departure.</p>

<p>"I may be gone all day," he announced, "It'd be
just like the scalawag to fool me and go around the
other way."</p>

<p>"It's probably a stray dog, anyway," she teased
after him as he started up the hill.</p>

<p>Jimmie went over the brow of the hill out of sight
of the house. When he was safe from observation he
hid his gun securely in the hollow hole of a tree, and,
skirting away around the hills out of sight of the sugar
camp and the road, he made his way as fast as his
legs could carry him toward Jethniah Gamblin's place
of business.</p>

<p>He found the United States post office closed and
locked at nine o'clock in the morning, and there was
no one in sight. He banged and rattled roughly at the
door, for in the course of his morning's walk he had
worked up a grievance against Jethniah and by this
time he was blaming him for everything that had
happened. There was a cautious movement within
the store and Jimmie saw a head appear near the
window from an ambuscade of flour sacks. The door
was slowly opened, a matter of inches, and Jimmie
squeezed his way in.</p>

<p>"What kind of a&mdash;?" Jimmie began upon his argument.
But Jethniah shut and bolted the door and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
retreated to an inner citadel behind the barricade of
post office boxes.</p>

<p>"What's the idea?" Jimmie inquired. "Have you
been tapping the postal revenues, or is it merely the
county sheriff that's coming for you."</p>

<p>But Mr. Gamblin had no heart for badinage. He
sat down heavily and groaned:</p>

<p>"Just like a post in the mud!"</p>

<p>Jimmie, looking around, saw that the door which
led from the store into Mr. Gamblin's living establishment
was shut and barred. He guessed, correctly, that
the store was a fortress under close siege. There was
an old overcoat and a store blanket over the back of
Jethniah's chair. It was fairly deducible that Mr.
Gamblin had spent the night in that chair. The old
man's face bore out the conclusion.</p>

<p>Wardwell suddenly found that his indignation at
the old man over yesterday's bargain had disappeared.
He was convinced that the buying of the horse from
Augusta had brought down vengeance on Jethniah's
head, from "that bitter voiced old woman," as he
recalled her. Certainly Mr. Gamblin did look punished.</p>

<p>"I came down about the horse," he said, as Jethniah
offered no explanation of the situation. "I don't believe
you were very keen on the bargain, anyway.
And the fact is that my wife misses the horse a whole
lot. Of course, a deal's a deal. But if I put it that my
wife didn't know how badly she was going to miss her
pet, and if I offer you ten dollars over what you paid
for him I thought maybe you might let me have the
horse back."</p>

<p>Mr. Gamblin struggled to his feet and ejaculated:</p>

<p>"Damn ten dollars! But if you'll only take your
cross-eyed, knock-kneed, horn-swoggled shin plaster
of a horse, and that calico travellin' house of a wagon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
away where my wife'll never see them again, why
maybe I can get into my own house again!"</p>

<p>Jimmie laughed. He knew that the old man's anger
was not really against Donahue. It was probably the
first chance he had had for a good many hours to say
a few words, and Wardwell sympathised with him.</p>

<p>Just then the door leading into the house was rattled
violently. It was plain that the old gentleman's raised
voice had penetrated the door.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jimmie hastily, "I haven't got the
money with me now, but I think I can get it before
night. And you'll let me have the horse?"</p>

<p>"Any whang-doodled thing you like!" said the old
man devoutly, as he reconnoitred towards the door
and opened it for Wardwell. "Only get the things
away from here before I get violent!"</p>

<p>Wardwell started for the railroad station and telegraph
office. It was mid-afternoon before he had an
answer to the wire which he sent. And it was later
still before the unwilling and suspicious operator grudgingly
counted out to him the money for which the
message called. But before dark he was back at Jethniah
Gamblin's and had handed the latter his money,
out in the open yard where a certain unmentioned
person might see that this was a bona fide transaction.</p>

<p>Donahue clattered contentedly up the track along
by the brook, while Jimmie glowed with the triumph
of achievement.</p>

<p>If he had known anything of women, he would have
known that he had that day committed the one sin
which a woman never forgives a man. And he would
already have begun to tremble against the day when
he would inevitably be found out. But he did not know
anything about women.</p>

<p>Augusta, worried and lonesome, had left the light
burning in the house, for it was now dark, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
wandered up toward the hill over which Jimmie had
gone in the morning. She heard the well remembered
rattle of the wagon coming up through the trees and
came running down, wondering.</p>

<p>She met Donahue squarely in the light from the
open door and rushed at him with a little whimper of
joy. The old horse reached his head down over her
shoulder and actually hugged her to him.</p>

<p>Wardwell came down from the wagon, and was
kissed without questions. The questions would come
later.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<p>"This was the time the Divil was goin' through
Athlone," John McQuade announced, giving the explanation
before the fact.</p>

<p>"I remember," Wardwell agreed politely. "He went
through 'in standing leaps.'"</p>

<p>McQuade and Jimmie were telling lies in a corner of
the sugar house.</p>

<p>It was the first "sugaring off" of the season. McQuade's
three sons and two hired men had been in the
camp ten days now, breaking roads through the settling
snow, scalding out sap buckets and boiling pans, and
tapping trees. Jimmie and Augusta, in wonder and
ignorance, had watched the men going from tree to
tree with augers, boring out a hole in each, into which
they drove the wooden spout, and hung the tin bucket
beneath. They stood among the bare trees on a southerly
slope of the hills where the late March sun of a
lovely morning beat warm and strong, and they saw a
miracle.</p>

<p>Neither of them had more than half believed that
sap would actually run from trees that stood stark and
apparently dead. But, as they stood there feeling the
drawing warmth of the sun in their own veins, it happened.
In the breathless hush of the morning a single
drop from a tree near them struck upon the resounding
bottom of the dry bucket like the stroke of a little bell.
It was a signal.</p>

<p>Up and down the sunny slope another and another
and a hundred other echoes of the little bell rang out
until the many sounds merged themselves into a single
tinkling chorus, and the sap of earth was running free!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
Mother nature was not dead. She had slept, and
now she was stirring to feed the hungry world. Jimmie
and Augusta looked at each other half shyly, as though
they had spied upon a Mystery.</p>

<p>That was four days ago, and since then, all day long,
the deliberate, unworried oxen had wallowed belly deep
through the melting snow, only approximately responsive
to excited shouts of "jee" and "haw," dragging
on the rough low sledges the hogsheads into which
the men emptied the buckets of sap from the trees.
Night and day the great brick furnace that ran full
length down the middle of the sugar house had roared.
Jimmie and Augusta had kept open fire in the front of
it during the bitterest of the winter, and Jimmie had
many times complained that his back was broken
carrying wood for it. But where he had carried armfuls,
the furnace now demanded cords. It raced and
danced and panted in a furious race with the running
sap, for the sap must be boiled down to syrup almost as
fast as it ran.</p>

<p>Already they had seen the dark, thick syrup poured
into the cans and sealed. And having eaten of it,
Jimmie and Augusta, used to the article that is sold in
bottles in our cities as pure maple syrup, wondered
what must become of this kind which they had now
tasted. For certainly nobody that they had ever known
had been rich enough to buy any of it.</p>

<p>But they had seen what they were told were the best
batches of the syrup put aside for the "sugaring off."
The term meant nothing to either of them, for they
had never heard of it before. But the constant reference
to it and the careful timing of everything that went on
in the camp with a sole regard for this event soon made
them look towards it as eagerly as if they had been a
sugar hungry boy and girl in the camp waiting for
nothing but the great day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Today McQuade had come for the event. And with
him had come Fan McQuade, his wife. She was a tall,
slender woman, unmistakably a daughter of women
who a hundred years ago and more trailed from Vermont
over into our North Country. There was strength
and unspent beauty in her face, and in spite of the
argument of her three mighty sons she seemed entirely
too young to be a mate for John McQuade. Her face
was grave and there was a thrifty tidiness about her
person and her speech that made you wonder how she
had ever come to marry a man like McQuade.</p>

<p>Of course, twenty years after the fact, you have the
same wonder as to why almost any woman married her
particular man. And most of them will tell you, in what
they think are moments of truth telling, that they
quarreled with the right man, and just took this one for
spite. All of which is probably just as true&mdash;and no
more so&mdash;as it is true that distant fields are greener than
the ones we are treading now.</p>

<p>But Augusta did wonder, on sight, how this grave
faced woman had given herself to the happy-go-lucky
young greenhorn that John McQuade probably had
been twenty-five years ago. She wondered, until she
heard Fan McQuade laugh. It was a surprised, and
surprising, burst of pure merriment, beginning with a
startled chuckle and ringing out into a clear peal of
sheer joy in fun. Then Augusta understood it all. This
girl of a sober race was not herself a fun maker, but she
loved to be made laugh. McQuade had made her laugh.
And he had then blarneyed his way into her heart, past
religious and racial and temperamental differences and
barriers that would have stopped a thoughtful man.</p>

<p>However, Augusta reflected, it must have been well
with them, for McQuade was still able to make his Fan
laugh. She laughed now as she overheard the unfolding
of McQuade's tale to Jimmie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
"The Divil was lookin' for a man by the name of
Barney McGonigle," McQuade stated gravely, while
Wardwell listened with the professional interest and
envy of a brother artist.</p>

<p>"Now, this man McGonigle, as I understand it, was a
man with a weakness. 'Twas known that he tasted
spirits. He had been drunk for two weeks. At the latter
end of that time, as luck would have it, he was a little
bit wide of his bearings. He wandered into an Orange
Lodge.</p>

<p>"The stairway going up to the Lodge room was
guarded with a drawn sword, of course. But McGonigle
came <i>down</i>. He'd been resting on the roof of the place.</p>

<p>"When McGonigle came in the Lodge was on its feet
and they were in the solemn act of repeating three times:
'To hell with the Pope.'</p>

<p>"There was some little excitement when McGonigle
came in without knockin', and he was fairly on his way
to being thrown through the window before the Grand
Master could rap for order.</p>

<p>"There was but one of two things to be done. Either
McGonigle must be killed outright. Or he must repeat:
'To hell with the Pope,' as they did.</p>

<p>"McGonigle bein' an agreeable man be nature, an'
his principles bein' far demoralized in drink, agreed to
say it.</p>

<p>"Had they watched him closer they might have seen
that he stopped a little before the last word.</p>

<p>"But, after all, McGonigle was a good neighbor, and,
barrin' the Seventeenth of March an' the Twelvth of
July, a good friend. Along with that, he was the only
journeyman farrier in the town. I misdoubt they were
only too glad to have him say it any way at all, and be
rid of him.</p>

<p>"When McGonigle came down past the drawn sword
into the sunshine he was thirsty, for water. He went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
down to the lough, thinkin' to drink at least the half
of it.</p>

<p>"In the middle of the first dhrink, the Divil leapt
down to the brink of the lough and stood forninst
McGonigle.</p>

<p>"'A word with you, Misther McGonigle,' says the
Divil, polite, but firm.</p>

<p>"McGonigle lifted one eye from his dhrinkin' and
saw the Divil confrontin him in the shape of a big black
horse with saddle and stirrups on him, but no bridle.</p>

<p>"'I need me breath for me dhrinkin',' says McGonigle.</p>

<p>"'Nevertheless,' says the Divil.</p>

<p>"'Gluggle, gluggle, gluggle,' says McGonigle, taking
another pull at the lough.</p>

<p>"With that, the Divil lost his temper, an' he stamped
an' he lepped till he shook the whole town, an' he shook
all the impudence out of poor McGonigle.</p>

<p>"'Get on me back,' commands the Divil.</p>

<p>"An' poor McGonigle, with the courage of the
whiskey dead in him, an his belly squishin' full o' lake
water, had no more gumption than to do as he was bid.</p>

<p>"Then it was that the Divil went bumping through
Athlone in standin' lepps, as you've heard. He was
tryin' to frighten McGonigle, for he was not sure
whether he had him truly in his power.</p>

<p>"'Ye said it,' accused the Divil, boundin' high
around a sharp corner.</p>

<p>"'I said what?' demands McGonigle circumstantial.
He knew right well that the Divil would never dare
repeat the Orangemen's invocation. For McGonigle in
his sober moments was a well read man, and, with a
moderate amount of dhrink in him, he was a theologian.</p>

<p>"'Come now, Barney me boy,' says the Divil,
wheedlin' snarefully, 'ye said it, an' ye know ye said it,
an' I know ye said it. So where's the use o' denyin'?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
"'I said,' says McGonigle, speakin' careful an'
precise&mdash;'To be sure I said part of it under me breath,
but I said it&mdash;I said: 'To hell with the <i>Anti</i>-pope'.'</p>

<p>"Now the Anti-pope, as you must know," McQuade
explained, "the Anti-pope was the Divil himself.</p>

<p>"Then there <i>was</i> a too-ru! The Divil was that mad
that he stood still and lepped straight up an' down. An'
he was so enraged at McGonigle that he got his foot
up into the stirrup beside McGonigle's, as though he
was tryin' to come up at him.</p>

<p>"'Glory be!' says McGonigle, lookin' down between
prayers. 'Look at the Omadhon tryin' to get on his own
back!'</p>

<p>"But, as McGonigle looked down he saw things. He
was an expert farrier, an' he knew that that was no
proper foot for a right horse. And, at this point, he was
enough of a theologian to remember that once a man
sees the Divil's cloven hoof he is not lost yet.</p>

<p>"An still the Divil raged, an' stamped, an' struggled
with his foot up in the stirrup.</p>

<p>"'That'll do,' says McGonigle, polite but hasty, as he
threw his leg free over the saddle, to jump. 'There's no
room here for two. If <i>you're</i> goin' to get <i>on</i>, <i>I'm</i> goin' to
get <i>off</i>!'"</p>

<p>The youngest of the McQuade boys came and laid a
pan of clean packed snow on the table in front of his
mother. This was part of the essential rites of the
sugaring off. The boys had, of course, barometers and
modern polarization tests which told them scientifically
when the heavy syrup, the concentration of many boilings
of sap, was sufficiently boiled down so that when
allowed to cool rapidly it would solidify into a clear
brittle cake with a polarization of over ninety-five.
Fan McQuade believed in all these things as fully as did
her sons. She lived with her boys and never allowed
anything in their business, or in new ways of doing old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
work, to get beyond her. But she&mdash;and they too&mdash;still
trusted her own test as to when a boiling of sugar was
ready to set properly.</p>

<p>So, when their thermometer and barometer showed
them that the proper point of condensation had been
reached, the boys came with a dipper and poured the
boiling sugar before her on the smooth surface of the
pan of snow. Then they stood gravely around and
watched while the long criss-crossed tendrills of sugar
which had been made in the pouring hardened over the
face of the snow.</p>

<p>Fan McQuade took a little white paddle of polished
maple, as hard almost as a piece of steel, and began
tapping gently at the hardening, waxy bars of sugar.
As the thin tendrils of sugar stiffened into long crystals
she struck harder, and they could hear a ringing from
them like the twang of distant skates on ice. Then, as
the sugar hardened to full brittleness the bars began to
break stiffly under her sharp blows, and then to crack
and snap and fly apart like live things.</p>

<p>Fan McQuade and her three sons nodded together
in solemn appreciation. Science and tradition were for
once agreed. They had caught the perfect boiling off
point. And the boys rushed away to pour off the contents
of the huge boiling pan into the cooling tins.</p>

<p>Now it was McQuade's time to bestir himself as host.</p>

<p>From the dark outside he brought in other pans of
clean frozen snow, which he had carefully prepared
against this moment. He laid the pans and paddles
about the table and inviting everybody to choose a
pan of snow he went to bring the wax syrup. To the
unitiated it looked like a bare banquet, a pan of snow
and a paddle. But the eating of "wax" is the one feast
that requires neither condiment nor foil.</p>

<p>"This," said McQuade, settling himself behind a
huge pan of wax, "is the one time when I can understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
this making of sugar. All the rest of the year I
think of these groves of idle trees,&mdash;there's nothing
in the world so idle as a maple tree&mdash;and every one of
them worth a pocketful of money, and I wonder at
Fan's lack of business sense. Why doesn't she cut
the timber down?"</p>

<p>He spoke of her impersonally, as though she might
have been, perhaps, a neighbor at home in the next
county.</p>

<p>"But," he concluded, "when I sit down with a pan
of wax in me arms I can understand it all. She keeps
the trees doing nothing the year 'round just to furnish
her her pan of wax. And, like the good Yankee that
she is, she has all the better of the bargain, at that."</p>

<p>"Hear him!" his wife retorted. "And if I dared to
have as much as one live tree of these groves cut down
he'd go crazy. I think he's a heathen pagan. I think
he comes up in the summer to worship in the groves
like the old people did in the Bible."</p>

<p>"They were high thinkin' people, I take it," said
McQuade, ready for contention. "But the times were
against them."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Fan McQuade slyly. "Or were
they leaving behind a good hard job of haying or something
when they ran off up into the groves for their
sacrifices?"</p>

<p>"That's right!" complained McQuade. "Go on and
tell all the neighbors about me and disgrace me! These
two young people don't think bad enough about me.
The first time they laid eyes on me they thought I
was a bank robber, at the very politest."</p>

<p>Augusta and Jimmie laughed happily over the
memory of that amazing evening when they had first
seen McQuade, and Augusta was starting to tell Mrs.
McQuade about their awakening the morning after,
while at the same time she was mechanically prodding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
about in the snow with her paddle to pick up more wax.
She looked down, surprised and disbelieving. McQuade
had given her a helping of wax so big that she had not
believed that she could eat a quarter of it. And, without
thinking or stopping, she had eaten up every bit
of it. <i>And she was hungry for more.</i></p>

<p>She looked up in horror, and exclaimed confusedly:</p>

<p>"I beg everybody's pardon. I never piggied anything
up so in my life!"</p>

<p>"Don't apologize, dear," said Fan McQuade, smiling
down into Augusta's burning face. "We'd've been
disappointed if you hadn't done just as you did. I
always distrust people who don't forget themselves
when they first eat sugar wax. I think there must be
something wrong with them."</p>

<p>Wardwell, who had done exactly as his wife had
done, had not even the grace to look guilty. With deliberate
optimism, he was making a hopeful estimate
on how many times he could repeat the performance.</p>

<p>McQuade was in no wise perturbed.</p>

<p>"Take breath, and we'll begin again fair. It's the
one thing," he explained, as he started away to bring
more, "that you can take too much of to-night, and
wake up wantin' more in the mornin'."</p>

<p>On his way to the fire he was stopped by the sound
of singing from outside. A loud, defiant voice broke
in above the panting of the furnace, inquiring lustily:</p>

<p>"<i>Where, Oh, where, are the vi-shuns of morning?</i>"</p>

<p>A determined knocking on the door punctuated the
song. And then the voice answered its own question
laconically:</p>

<p>"<i>Gone like the flow-ers that bloom in the Spring
time.</i>"</p>

<p>"Jethniah Gamblin's warble!" exclaimed McQuade
gleefully, skipping to the door. The door had to be
kept bolted on account of the heavy draught of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
furnace, so, when McQuade opened it quickly, the
stout figure of the postmaster was fairly propelled
toward the middle of the floor, while his hat, blown
from his head by the force of the draught, made a
bee line for the bottom door of the furnace. Wardwell
sprang to the rescue, but the old man, with a whoop
and a most surprising show of agility, swooped down on
the hat as it was about disappearing into the furnace
and came up jamming it triumphantly upon his head.</p>

<p>"Just like a post in the mud!" he announced.</p>

<p>McQuade came back from his struggle with the
door, and made him welcome.</p>

<p>"Sit in, Jethniah, sit in. Ye know the folks here, and
yer as welcome as the flowers ye were sing-songin'
about."</p>

<p>Jethniah said "How-dye-do" to everybody and
found a place for himself beside Wardwell.</p>

<p>He said nothing, nor was anyone tactless enough to
ask him, as to what desperate or devious means he had
used in accomplishing his liberty for the evening. But, as
he settled his short, fat arms around the pan of snow
which McQuade had brought him, there was apparent
around his mouth a fine cat-and-canary smile that had
its own meaning for every one of his observers.</p>

<p>"I just smelt the sugaring, and invited myself,"
he explained officially to Fan McQuade.</p>

<p>"I'm sure we would have missed you sincerely,"
said the hostess earnestly. "But I think John trusted
your instincts, for I'm pretty sure he was expecting
you to-night."</p>

<p>McQuade came back and criss-crossed everybody's
pan of snow with a generous helping of wax, providing a
double portion for Jethniah that he might overtake
the others.</p>

<p>In the midst of his busy eating, Jethniah was seen
to stop and reach hastily into an inner pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
"Never tell us you've forgot it!" said McQuade in
evident alarm.</p>

<p>"Safe as a hollow tooth!" proclaimed Jethniah,
withdrawing his hand, reassured, and beginning afresh
at his wax. "Just like a post in the mud!"</p>

<p>Augusta and Wardwell looked at each other, guessing
what it might be that was as safe as if hidden in a
hollow tooth. But they did not ask, knowing that,
whatever it was, it would be better to wait and find
out at the proper time.</p>

<p>The fact in the matter was not that Jethniah had
feared that he had forgotten something. He was afraid
that he had been robbed.</p>

<p>Jethniah Gamblin had a vice. It was not a secret
vice. But it was the more persuasive, insidious and
devastating in that it was encouraged and abetted by
the entire community.</p>

<p>During official hours Jethniah was a faithful servant
of the People of the United States, and during the
same hours he was an honest weigher of sugar and
sundries. But when, at eight o'clock in the evening,
he had put out the lights and had, in the dark, taken
the postage stamps from their place in the drawer
and hidden them in an old rubber boot that stood in a
corner, Jethniah reverted to the pursuit of his vice.</p>

<p>Jethniah, to say the worst at once, was a leader in
song. Wherever there was a gathering of any sort, within
possible walking distance, there was Mr. Gamblin
to be found in the midst of it. It had to be within
walking distance, for many ignominious failures had
taught Jethniah that he could not hitch up a horse
and drive out of the barn without arousing deadly and
effective opposition to his going. So, Jethniah's goings
were on foot, with celerity, and without announcement.
But go he did, usually. And he was always welcome,
because, at the very first hand, the event of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
coming or not coming gave an immediate sporting
interest to the party. Where people in other less favored
communities had to get through the early, dragging
moments of every social function talking about the
weather and fussing awkardly until the crowd came,
the gatherings within Jethniah's range were put at
ease immediately by the common interest in the question
of whether or not the Postmaster would be able
to make his escape from home, and attend. Wagers
on the matter were posted freely, with the prevailing
odds in Jethniah's favor, this partly through sympathy
but largely through faith based on Jethniah's past
performances.</p>

<p>Then, when he did appear, he was questioned anxiously
as to whether he had brought his tuning fork safe
with him. For there had been occasions in local history
when Jethniah had arrived at a party without this
badge of his calling and authority. On these occasions
Mr. Gamblin had explained that he had "somehow
missed" the tuning fork. But everybody knew better.
Mr. Gamblin had been robbed, temporarily.</p>

<p>In the winter evenings of his young manhood Jethniah
had taught singing school in school-houses among the
hills. But he had long since given up the professional
side of his art, and now devoted himself whole-heartedly
to the cultivation and encouragement of song, for song's
pure sake.</p>

<p>So, whether it was a wedding anniversary or the
aftermath of a quilting or a husking bee or an honest
country dance with no excuse whatever, Jethniah and
his tuning fork were in demand. For when the riotous
edge of the merry-making was dulled people wanted to
sing. The songs were mostly sad ones, for people
generally get more enjoyment out of sad songs, and
there are more of them; but when Jethniah stood up and
drew forth his tuning fork, carefully and critically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
testing it by snapping it with his finger nail, his face
grave as that of a very priest of music, his stout old
body swaying to the tune that was already humming
in his head, he was in those moments a great
man.</p>

<p>That men and women loved Jethniah and encouraged
him heartily in his weakness is not to be wondered at.
For it is a singular fact that, whereas few persons can
persuade themselves that they are beautiful, or profoundly
wise, or inordinately brave, and only a very few
extremely happy folks can delude themselves into believing
that they are all three, yet practically all people
in their secret hearts believe that they can sing, or,
what is the same thing, that they <i>could</i> sing if they were
encouraged.</p>

<p>Thus Jethniah, who in the long years had given up
the exacting and critical attitude of the teacher and had
developed a broad charity in art which looked only to
the spirit and good will of the performance, encouraged
and gave license to the craving that lies deep in all
men's souls, to lift up their heads and howl. Men and
women, who, left to themselves, would no more have
dared try to sing than they would have attempted to
walk a tight rope, shouted themselves hoarse and happy
under Jethniah's all-condoning tuning fork.</p>

<p>When McQuade had hoped devoutly that Mr. Gamblin
had not forgotten it, he referred, of course, to the
justly celebrated tuning fork. Now when Jethniah had
eaten all the wax that McQuade could press upon him,
and when everyone else had stopped from sheer inability
to proceed, McQuade was anxious for further
festivities.</p>

<p>But Jethniah was unwontedly reluctant about starting
a singing match. He felt half afraid to get upon his
feet for he was aware that the centre of gravity in his
short, round body had been shifted by the quantities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
sugar which he had eaten so that, standing, he would
have been in the state which Physics calls <i>unstable
equilibrium</i>, and his stomach was so full that, for certain
physiological reasons, he was afraid to strain his
diaphragm with the effort of singing. He had had a
brisk walk against a stiff, cold wind, and the warm, full
condition of his stomach and the heated air of the cabin
combined to throw a heavy lethargy over him. Jethniah
at that point would have given a great deal to be
allowed to take a short nap. But McQuade was for
immediate action.</p>

<p>"Never tell us ye left your music at home on the
piano rack! Ye did not, for ye couldn't, unless ye were
to leave your head there too. For it's in that round
head o' yours that ye carry the finest ripertor of good
tunes and words with them of any man in the country.
There's not a postmaster in all these great United
States that has the songs an' the music in him that ye
have," McQuade cajoled.</p>

<p>"It's right hard on the voice," complained Jethniah,
standing on professional grounds, "to sing after heavy
eatin'."</p>

<p>"Eatin'?" said McQuade contemptuously. "I don't
call that eatin' at all. We'll <i>eat</i> after we've had a song or
two. You'll sing, an' I'll sing, an' we'll all sing. Out with
the tunin' fork!"</p>

<p>"Can't you tell a few lies, till we get our breath?"
Jethniah suggested weakly.</p>

<p>"No. We'll have all the night to tell stories in after
the girls are in bed. Now we'll sing," McQuade announced
mercilessly.</p>

<p>Jethniah brought out the tuning fork reluctantly,
snapping it critically and holding it up to his ear and
listening doubtfully to the tone. He seemed to be
artistically dissatisfied with the instrument and to be
very hopeless as to the success of the whole project of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
singing. The truth was that he knew he was not in good
fettle for singing and he was nervous about Wardwell
and Augusta because they were, after all, strangers, and
they might laugh.</p>

<p>But when McQuade had cleared away the pans of
snow, Jethniah stretched himself as far as he dared and
began to take an interest. He struck the tuning fork on
the table several times, and as he listened his face became
each time a little more hopeful.</p>

<p>Finally he caught the tone satisfactorily and announced,
with a rising sweep of his free hand:</p>

<p>"<i>Oh He Hum Ha-a-a-ah</i>," crescendo, and holding the
last note while he beamed and nodded hopefully around
his audience.</p>

<p>"We will sing 'John Brown's Body' first," Jethniah
announced. He arose manfully and smote the tuning
fork sharply on the table. And again he gave the key
note, this time with authority and confidence.</p>

<p>"All sing!"</p>

<p>It was rather a straggling performance, for the boys
and men working around the fires came along two or
three notes behind the leaders, and McQuade and
Wardwell were so full of sugar that they could hardly do
more than grunt. But when Jethniah heard Augusta's
voice with him he took mighty heart and together they
carried it through to a triumph.</p>

<p>Jethniah now awoke to the possibilities of the occasion.
He had come here primarily to eat sugar. But in
the prospect of a brilliant singing affair he was willing to
forget even the first sugar eating of the season. If only
he had not eaten quite so much already!</p>

<p>He next called for "Annie Laurie," and when that
went through to a decided success, Jethniah was so
carried that he insisted on rendering the "Kerry
Dancers," which he had learned on Sundays spent
fishing with McQuade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
And McQuade returned the compliment in a way
that went to Mr. Gamblin's heart.</p>

<p>"Jethniah," he reminisced, in the pause that followed
their latest effort, "d' ye mind the day we were fishin'
the Racquette away below Forked Lake, and ye made a
little song all out of your own head and sang it for me?"</p>

<p>"Does seem to me now," said Jethniah hesitating.
McQuade was the best of friends, but he was an inveterate
joker and Jethniah was always a little afraid
of his humor when there was company. "But I can't
just think right now. What about it?" he inquired
cautiously. He remembered the little song very well.
He had been humming it to himself ever since that day
last summer when he had sung it for McQuade, but he
had never had the hardihood to bring it out and teach
it to people as his own composition. Jethniah was a
kindly man, and easily hurt; and in this matter he had
all of the fledgling author's fear of ridicule.</p>

<p>"Then it's me that remembers," said McQuade,
triumphantly pulling a wallet from his hip pocket.
From the wallet he drew out a little account book and
found in it the page for which he looked. He handed it,
open, to Jethniah, saying:</p>

<p>"There it's for you now. I copied it fair that day an'
told you it ought to be in print. Let's hear it now,
Jethniah, and we'll all learn it and give it a rousin' send
off. Sing up, man! Sing up!"</p>

<p>Mr. Gamblin took the little book and began adjusting
his spectacles to his kindling eyes. He was so proud
and so pleased with McQuade's graceful thought that
his hand shook as he held the little book up to the light
of a lantern. Of course he knew the words by heart, but
not for worlds would he have foregone the heady delight
of reading his own work as it had been copied by some
one who had thought well of it. It was almost as good as
if he had actually seen it in print.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Finally he turned to McQuade and looked up at him
over the rims of the spectacles. There was a misty dimness
in the kindly, honest old eyes as he silently thanked
his friend.</p>

<p>"Sing up, man. Sing up&mdash;Or I'll howl it meself!"
blustered McQuade.</p>

<p>Jethniah began to hum, and then to sing tentatively.
But his enthusiasm quickly mounted above his shyness,
and grasping the tuning fork in a stout hand he brought
it down sharply on the table. Then taking the fresh tone
boldly and beating time with McQuade's little book in
one hand and the tuning fork in the other, he struck
bravely into his little song.</p>

<p>Sang Jethniah:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Get up with the sun in the <i>morn</i>-ing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now <i>that's</i> a beautiful thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie low in your bed till the <i>noon</i>-time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now <i>that's</i> a beautiful thing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Work hard till the end like a <i>good</i> man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now <i>that's</i> a beautiful thing.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now <i>that's</i> a beautiful thing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Who picks out my work for the <i>Long</i> Day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell Him I want to do <i>both</i> things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell Him I want to do <i>both</i> things."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Never did poet and songster have a happier audience
for his maiden effort, for before he had gotten to the
second verse they were joining him in the refrain and
assuring him <i>that</i> that was a beautiful thing. And when
it was finished McQuade led round after round of
applause, while the boys roared and cheered around the
fires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
"Again!" shouted McQuade. "Let us hear it again,
till we learn it, an' we'll sing the roof off with it."</p>

<p>Again Jethniah smote the table with the tuning fork
and sang now as though he would burst his stout old
heart. And then they all stood about him, the boys
towering and blackened like young Vulcans from their
work among the fires, and Jethniah led a triumph that
roared above the panting of the fires and shook the
rafters of the solid old cabin. It was the supreme
moment of Jethniah's life. And McQuade, whose heart
was big for his friend's glory&mdash;and who dearly loved a
racket anyway&mdash;wanted to fill that moment to the very
brim. Again and again they had to sing through the
song, until, in very pity for Jethniah, Fan McQuade put
a partial stop upon the performance.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to save sugar by making your guests
sing all night," she said pointedly to her husband.</p>

<p>McQuade apologized loudly and ran for the snow
pans. They sat down again, and, to Wardwell's astonished
delight and to Augusta's dismay, they found that
their appetite for wax was practically undulled.</p>

<p>But Augusta soon saw that Fan McQuade was very
tired&mdash;she and McQuade, since sun-rise, had driven
fifty miles over the most frightful of roads&mdash;and
Augusta herself was glad to have this as an excuse for
pleading that she and Mrs. McQuade be allowed to
retire to their beds in the little camp house, for she
knew that as long as she stayed she would inevitably
eat more sugar, and, in spite of McQuade's assurances,
she was afraid of the consequences.</p>

<p>As McQuade had predicted, they told lies after the
"girls" were gone to bed. But it was evident that the
singing was not neglected. For, ever and again during
the night, Augusta, dozing lightly in her hammock, was
awakened to listen sleepily to Jethniah's pleasant
philosophy of a future in which he would like to be up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and doing and be dozing abed, be working and loafing,
all at the same time.</p>

<p>Augusta and Wardwell long remembered this night.
It was not that it was marked by any occurrence vital
to themselves. It was merely the first night since they
had come out upon the road that they had been separated.
But it was full of new experiences for them, and
somehow it seemed to mark an epoch, to put an end to
one thing and to begin another.</p>

<p>McQuade and his Fan left the next day, already
anxious to be at home, for Spring on the big dairy farm
that was their home was a busy and important time.</p>

<p>Other parties, invited by the McQuade boys, and
some that were not invited, came to eat sugar. But
Jimmie and Augusta did not join in any of these festivities.
Augusta knew that few people had Mr. Gamblin's
ready sympathy or McQuade's big, hearty understanding.
She did not care to be stared at and questioned
as the curiosity that had come into the country
in a gypsy wagon and had lived so strangely all winter
in the sugar camp. She had learned that a sparsely
settled country neighborhood is the most inquisitive and
imaginative community in the world. And while she had
laughed with Wardwell over the strange stories that were
told, and believed, to account for their presence here,
yet she did not propose to put herself upon exhibition.</p>

<p>The sugar season was over quickly, for the sap runs
only in the brief period while the frost is actually leaving
the ground, and it was a matter only of days until
the men were hurriedly gathering the buckets and
scalding them out and scouring the boiling pans to be
stored away for the year under the rafters of the big
cabin. Then they loaded their ox carts with the golden
garnering of their hard work and drove shouting away
down roads that were mere wallows of soft snow and
mud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Augusta and Jimmie turned gladly back to the freedom
and the quiet of their work. It had been a most
wonderful winter for them. There must, in the actual
constitution of human nature, have been times when
they were both horribly lonesome, when they must have
longed for something to happen or for the sight of a new
face. But there was very little that was petty or unforgiving
in either of them, and love, which came deeper
and sweeter to them with every turning day, with
growing understanding of each other, with little unthought,
unstudied kindnesses, love blessed them with a
happiness that was almost fearful.</p>

<p>Their work, too,&mdash;for they squabbled desperately
over it at times&mdash;furnished a ready ground wire to conduct
off the too high tension of living so closely and
solely with each other. That amazing book, which had
been written by a method that had nothing but originality
to commend it, had come along so surprisingly
that Wardwell, always a grudging critic of his own
work, had walked around in violent alternations of
feeling. At one moment he was confident that the work
was fine, and ten minutes later he would be attacked
by a sickening distrust that, after all, they must be
"kidding themselves."</p>

<p>Augusta's faith had never wavered. She knew that
the book was at all times as good as Jimmie's best, and
she wanted nothing more than that. Measured in
written words, her own part in it was not great. But
Wardwell knew that, from the moment she had come
into it, the soul of the book was Augusta's own spirit
in it.</p>

<p>When it was finished and Jimmie had waded down
through breast-deep January drifts to the railroad station
to mail the manuscript, and had come back with
empty hands, Augusta sat down and cried bitterly. She
had gotten to so love the book that, toward the end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
every physical touch that she gave it was a caress. And
now that it was gone it seemed almost as though a little
fledgling boy of theirs had been driven out into a cold,
blustering world to make his way alone.</p>

<p>But Jimmie was crafty in waiting, and wise in ways
to disappoint disappointment.</p>

<p>"Don't let them see that we're anxious, darling," he
counselled warily. "Let's just keep saying that we
don't care a rap, and that we expect it to be rejected
anyway. Then maybe it'll get by." He had all of an
Ethiopian's superstition that the little gods of mischief
were always watching around to snatch away the thing
on which one set his heart too openly.</p>

<p>"We'll get right to work on something else," he said,
holding Augusta curled up in his lap and petting her,
"and pretend that we've forgotten all about it." He
remembered grim, waiting days in the past when he had
listened to the postman's whistle and had not dared to
go down like a man to see what the mail had brought
him, but had peeped shame-faced down the stairs at
the hall table where the letters were piled, always
expecting to see the thick neat packet of manuscript
that meant another hope rejected.</p>

<p>Now it was all different, for he had another to think
of. And his anxiety was not for the outcome itself so
much as it was to save Augusta from the bitterness of a
first crushing disappointment. The best that they could
expect&mdash;he tried to tell her&mdash;was that the book might
be considered, and, perhaps, if they could make the
changes that the publisher would be sure to want,
might be finally accepted. But, in any case, it would
be at least a year before the book would bring them
anything, either advertising or reputation or money,
or anything else.</p>

<p>In the very first place they must begin to write some
things that might be quickly turned into money. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
must do some short stories at once. He had some,
Jimmie said, which had been bumping around in his
head all the time while he had been busy with the book.
Now he would round them up and put them to work.
They must make some money right away.</p>

<p>If Augusta wondered at his sudden anxiety about
money, she did not ask questions. She was not incurious,
but she never pried. She knew that he was sensitive
about money, and that he was becoming more so. But
she did not know of any new reason for his hurry to
make money. She had known vaguely that he must have
borrowed money that time when he had bought Donahue
back for her, but she knew that he would not wish
to be questioned on the matter, and she had refrained
from speculating on it.</p>

<p>Wardwell was beginning to know that, in that time,
he had done something that in the nature of things was
altogether wrong. He did not know just why it was so
very wrong. But he knew that it was beginning to
bother him a great deal. And, in a man's foolish way of
only seeing one thing, he believed that if he could only
get money now it would set the whole thing right.</p>

<p>They had gone to work then, gravely pretending to
have forgotten all about the ship that had gone to sea.
And, to an extent, they did forget it. For Jimmie had
some very good ideas for short stories and he fell to
work upon them with an energy that surprised himself.
And Augusta at first pecking diffidently at the typewriter,
and then striking boldly for herself into untried
waters, found herself at the end of three days almost
hopelessly bewildered and drifting. Her story, which had
seemed so easy and simple in the starting, would not go
forward. And for three days more she sat futilely writing
pages which she knew she would presently tear up.
Jimmie sat by and at times he grinned sympathetically,
but he offered no help, except to threaten to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Augusta out and roll her in the snow if she persisted in
sitting too long and closely at the typewriter. Then,
when she was almost ready to cry in despair, the story
began somehow to move, and almost before she knew
what was happening it ran out to a triumphant conclusion
that she had hardly dreamed of.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful little story, wind bitten, sun sweet,
like Augusta's own self. And Jimmie knew that it was
true work. Though she begged him to re-write it for her
as he had done with what she had composed for the
book, Jimmie would not touch it. He showed her a few
places where her lack of training to the trade had left
defects in construction. And when she had copied in her
own corrections he took the story and addressed it and
carried it proudly down to the railroad station.</p>

<p>After that their waiting and anxiety was all for the
fate of Augusta's little story. And when, a full week
before there was any reasonable hope for an answer from
it, Wardwell went down to the station and actually
brought home an acceptance and a check for it, they
forgot everything and danced and capered about the
fire in Indian glee.</p>

<p>"I shall now," said Jimmie comfortably, sitting down
as the excitement subsided a little, "devote myself to
the instruction of an appreciative future generation.
I'll write for posterity, while my wife writes for bread
and bacon."</p>

<p>But Augusta was not there to hear. She had taken the
check and run out through the snow, to show it to
Donahue.</p>

<p>From that time on through the winter Jimmie's
weekly journeyings down to the station were an event.
They had agreed to avoid the use of Jethniah's much
nearer post office, not because they had anything to
conceal from their old friend but because they did not
wish to be discussed by the inevitable winter gossips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
who sat on Jethniah's nail kegs and pilfered his soda
crackers, so they had mail only once in the week. And
every week now there was something to be hoped for,
some manuscript to be heard from which they both said
aloud would probably come back rejected, but which in
their secret hearts they both thought "might stick," as
Jimmie sometimes diffidently phrased it. For Augusta
had fallen into Jimmie's way of never voicing the highest
hope, lest a jealous power should hear and blast it.
And they were for all the world like a pair of old
fashioned New England parents who would never
dare boast about their offspring, for that would mean
that the children would surely come to some bad
end.</p>

<p>They were so busy, and so happy in the varying ups
and downs of hopes, disappointments and realizations,
that when the letter came saying that the publishers
were pleased with Wardwell's book and that, if agreeable
to him, they would forward him a contract for its
publication on the usual royalty basis, it hardly caused
any more than the usual weekly excitement. It did not,
in fact, reach up to half the importance of Augusta's
first little check.</p>

<p>Wardwell was not disappointed, for he had not expected
any other proposal than this one that had been
made for the book. But he was not exactly satisfied.
He would have much preferred to try to get a cash
offer for the manuscript. For he was still sensitive to the
thought that Augusta had spent on account of him all
the little money that had been left from her mother,
and that she was now, even though they had both
begun to earn some money, practically penniless. He
thought that he could not feel right again until he had
been able to put into her hands at least the amount of
money which she had had in the beginning. It was a
little, unworthy way of looking at the matter, compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
with the unthought, whole-hearted way in which
Augusta had done the thing&mdash;and Wardwell knew this.
But Jimmie was not, in these days, seeing things with
his usual clear vision.</p>

<p>There was another matter&mdash;a matter that had been
hanging over him since the day when he had telegraphed
for money to buy back Donahue&mdash;which was hanging
over him and spoiling his imagination and his insight.
However, there was nothing that he could do except to
work on as rapidly as he could.</p>

<p>Now that the noisy interruption of the sugaring had
passed they turned back happily to the habits of their
work&mdash;if indeed their ways of doing things could be
called habits, for they worked or played or ate, or did
none of these things, very much as the spirit of the
moment suggested.</p>

<p>They had been obliged to take Mr. Gamblin into
their confidence, for the checks which had been coming
were of no practical use to them here, and it was necessary
to have a banker.</p>

<p>"Checks" said Jethniah, when Jimmie had shown
him the first of their earnings and had asked him to
deposit them. "I thought all checks had Boynton &amp;
Bailey's name on 'em, and was to pay the farmers for
milk."</p>

<p>"You needn't cash them now you know, Mr. Gamblin.
If you'll just let them go through your bank down
in Tupper, why, you can give us the money any time
after they've gone through and so you can't be taking
any risk at all."</p>

<p>"Risk!" Jethniah grumbled. "Who said risk? I
wouldn't know this here Eagle Publishing Coe from
Adam's pet hyena if I met them both face to face, an'
this here Bank of Manhattan may be an ingrowin' hole
in the ground for all I know. But you've writ your name
on the back of one of these checks and your wife's writ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
hers on t'other. An' that says they're good. So they're
good.</p>

<p>"That's me, every time. Just like a post in the mud."</p>

<p>He gave his trousers a premonitory heave, as if to advise
them of what was going to happen. And striking
down deep into the right fore pocket he pulled forth a
good roll of bills and began to count.</p>

<p>"But say?" he queried, in a gentle, wondering tone
that invited confidence. "Don't you honestly have to do
<i>any</i> work at all&mdash;just write down things&mdash;and have
them send you checks?"</p>

<p>"Not another thing," Jimmie asserted stoutly.</p>

<p>"Gosh all Fish 'ooks!" Jethniah exploded admiringly.
"Why don't everybody do it!"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Wardwell solemnly. "I've
always wondered."</p>

<p>As the weeks drew on into the opening Spring,
Augusta, sensitive always as a poplar leaf, began to
feel that from somewhere a crisis was impending upon
them. There was no tangible thing that could be a
source of apprehension to them. The question of money,
which had once been terrible for them, was now happily
resolving itself into the simplest incidental of their
work. Jimmie, she was at last sure, could for the rest
of his life laugh at the threat of the disease which had
driven them out upon the road. The Winter, which had
indeed been formidable for them, was past; and for the
Summer, which would be coming before very long, they
would be as comfortable and as nicely situated as they
could wish. They were welcome to stay on here. Or, if
they were tired of the solitude and the closeness of the
life, they knew that they could now easily earn as much
as they needed to live nicely in almost any place.</p>

<p>Materially, it was plain, nothing could threaten
them. For they were now as independent as it is possible
for two people to be on this earth, where the price of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
living must always be paid in some kind. Even what is
called independent wealth could not have made them
more free than they were, because, with that, they
would have more things to fear than they now had.</p>

<p>But Augusta well knew that this presentiment, which
came treacherously stealing upon her in the dreaming
moments when her spirit was wandering alone and unguarded
in that border land where dreams and good
stories come from, was not warning her against any
material happening.</p>

<p>With a prescience as cruel as eye-sight could have
been, she knew that this thing would strike at her heart.
And, her heart could only be hurt through Jimmie.</p>

<p>Long ago she had foreseen and trembled at this day
when love would make a coward of her. And although
many times in the year past she had been able to believe
that Jimmie loved her truly, the way a man chooses his
girl and wants her, and not from any prompting of duty
or mere affection, yet the fact remained, unescapable
and unanswerable: <i>they had not started fair</i>.</p>

<p>She had taken Jimmie at his word, when pity, and
probably affection, and a pretty childish attractiveness,
had prompted him to ask her to marry him. But, even
then, she had known that it was not fair, for, even then,
though neither of them would have believed this, she
had been a woman while he was an impulsive boy.</p>

<p>It was true that even in that time she had loved him
with a love which he would not have believed her
capable of even guessing at. But that made no difference.
Jimmie had not been free. Nothing that had since
passed had altered that fact. And Augusta had cruelly
whipped herself into believing, that even if Jimmie had
not cared for her in any way, his quick heart and his
kindness for her mother and herself would have made
him do just what he had done in the circumstances.
(She was able to believe this because she knew that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
herself, at that time, would have married the most
repulsive man in the world if it had been a necessary
condition for getting her mother out of the madhouse.)</p>

<p>All this had lain away covered in her mind through
the months of happiness and well being and hopeful,
heart-filling work. But it was inevitable, as she had
always known, that it would one day come forth and
stalk upon her.</p>

<p>The outward signs that the peace of her mind and the
safety of her love were being threatened were indeed
very slight. Jimmie was restless. Something was troubling
him, that much she knew. Once or twice she had
felt that he was on the point of speaking out, but the
moment had passed and had left her with the dizzy,
sinking feeling of a threat suspended.</p>

<p>Sometimes she was able to lull the feeling of foreboding
evil by the thought that it was merely the
Spring. Everything about them was restless and stirring
and shooting forth buds and blades, and all the little
rivers of life were running full. It was only to be expected
that they themselves, coming out of the close,
storm bound life of the Winter, should feel a stirring of
unrest, an urge of discontent and energy, towards
something new.</p>

<p>Also, she knew that their reading of the war in
Europe had been having an unsettling effect upon both
of them. In the days of last Summer and Fall, when
Jimmie's health was her single thought and when he
himself was still subject to recurrent days of feverishness
during which the doings of the world lost their
interest for him, the first news of the world's tragedy
had come dribbling to them through occasional old
newspapers borrowed from Mr. Gamblin's store, and
it had hardly aroused in them anything more than a
puzzled and only half believing wonder. Belgium was
mutilated&mdash;But Jimmie's temperature must be watched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Later, however, when the shadow was definitely
lifted from Wardwell's life, they began to follow the
war with an avidity that was proportional to their
detachment from the diversions and worries which
took up the thoughts of other people more normally
situated. They subscribed for a New York daily paper,
and when Jimmie came home from the station with a
week's papers in a bundle they sat down and devoured
them eagerly.</p>

<p>Augusta, all pity and eager partisanship for the
innocent and for the right, was disappointed in Jimmie.
He, being half boy and whole writing man, thought
only of the noise and the whole whaling wonder of the
thing, and she wondered that he could take it all so
impartially. But now there came a May day when
Jimmie came home with his bundle of mail and tramped
heavily into the room, without speaking.</p>

<p>He walked over to where she sat at the typewriter.
Before her, over the machine, he spread a paper and
laid his hand on the broad headlines. They told of the
Lusitania horror.</p>

<p>After a little he leaned over her shoulder, as she read
in silence, and pointed down a column of the known
dead to the name of a man&mdash;a writing man&mdash;whom he
had loved.</p>

<p>He walked slowly over to the table in the corner and
dropped the mail quietly. Augusta stole a look at him
as he stood there, leaning over slightly, brooding, his
big hands, rough and red from work and wind, knuckled
down hard on the bare table.</p>

<p>She was struck by a sense of something missing. The
boyishness was gone from Jimmie's face. And, with a
little shiver, she knew that she would never see it
again. Her playboy had vanished. She was looking at a
man who had hardened into a mold within the hour.</p>

<p>She had never seen Jimmie angry, for he had practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
no temper. And he was not angry now, in any
ordinary sense of the word. His face was no study. It
was plain, and ugly with a single emotion. The emotion
was as plain, and as old, as blood&mdash;revenge.</p>

<p>But Augusta knew that it was not the restlessness of
Spring that threatened her. And she knew that not even
the sullen restiveness of a call of blood could hurt in the
way that she was going to be hurt.</p>

<p>She was a woman. And she knew that only through a
woman could she be wounded to her heart's depth. That
strange prescience, that border land insight which had
come to her in other times, and had sometimes been
kind to her and sometimes cruel, had lately been turning
up pictures to her mind. And although she had not
admitted them to her ordinary, self-controlled consciousness,
yet fragments of them always remained,
and in spite of her will to dissolve them she found them
becoming more and more clearly parts of a composite
picture of a woman&mdash;the tall, black woman whom she
had seen that day when the Irish gypsy girl had forced
the cards into her hands.</p>

<p>Now this was all in spite of her will. Her good sense,
as she called it, fought these things down again and
again. She would not let herself be morbid. And yet,
all the time, her soul was summoning courage against
the blow. When she should know that Jimmie wanted
to go from her, she must make him free. That had been
in the bond from the beginning. She herself had put
it in the vow of her marriage.</p>

<p>On a morning just beyond the middle of May when
the plum trees were all in white blossom, which, as all
the world knows, is the one elect time for brook fishing,
Jimmie went fishing.</p>

<p>Augusta stayed at home with the avowed, and
honest, intention of fixing a dress. Their clothes had
stood the rough wear remarkably well. But, as good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
clothes will do, now that they were beginning to go they
seemed to give out everywhere at once.</p>

<p>But Augusta never took any pleasure in fixing her
own clothes. So by the time she had taken down her
good dress and looked it over, and had poked tentatively
at several slightly worn places in it, she decided
that it was Jimmie's wardrobe that really needed attention.</p>

<p>His one fair coat was not at all what it should be.
And she knew there was a rip under the right armhole.
She must do that first. She would give it a thorough
beating and cleaning and let it hang a while in the
sweetening sun. The first thing was to clean out the
pockets and turn them wrong side out. He always carried
such truck in his pockets! Cigarette papers, loose
matches&mdash;it was a miracle that he didn't burn himself
up, improvised lead sinkers, stubs of lead pencils, a few
loose cartridges, letters from publishers, scraps and
pieces that had once been white paper and had had
parts of stories written on them. She shucked them all
out on the table and stood looking down at them with
some of the consternation and wonder with which a
young mother looks at the amazing contents of her
boy's trouser pockets.</p>

<p>Long afterwards it came to Augusta as one of the
bitterest things of all that her blow should have come
upon her in what might have been the way of cheap and
tawdry melodrama. She might have been a snooping
wife going jealously through her husband's pockets.</p>

<p>She stood there a long time staring down at a letter
that, of its own power it seemed, stood out apart and
separated from all the rest. She did not touch the letter.
There was no power in her, nor no wish, to turn a page
of it. It had no envelope. And it had, with insensate
malice, spread out the whole of its front page to her
eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
It was a love letter, one link of a chain of established
correspondence between a woman and Jimmie Wardwell.</p>

<p>After the first, heart-withering look at the page which
gave her this complete, all-embracing intelligence,
Augusta did not read. She stood staring dumbly, and
then, still keeping her eyes helplessly on the page, she
began to back, step by step, cowering away from it.</p>

<p>Creeping backward still, she came against the chair
on which she had thrown her dress. Her hand went out
mechanically and she grasped the dress, just where she
had stuck the forgotten needle in it.</p>

<p>The pain of the piercing needle mercifully took her
eyes away from that letter. She pulled the needle from
where it had stuck in the palm of her hand, and mechanically
brought the hurt up to her lips.</p>

<p>Then she looked at the dress. What was it doing
there?</p>

<p>Oh yes! She remembered. She was going away. She
had always known that she was going away. Now it was
the time.</p>

<p>She took the dress and carried it over behind the little
curtain of her hammock bed.</p>

<p>When she was ready to go, she sat down at the typewriter
and wrote a line in the middle of a clean sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>She was not herself, of course; and we do not know
just what was passing in her mind. But she wrote:</p>

<p><i>We may not live together. We shall not die apart.</i></p>

<p>As she rose from the typewriter she looked again,
because she could not help it, at the letter, and in the
lower part of the page that lay open before her she
saw clearly the words "your Jean."</p>

<p>She did not need these words to tell her what she
already knew, that the letter was from the woman
with whom Jimmie had promised to have nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
do. For she had already seen, in the first moment, a
flash of the woman's dark, handsome, discontented
face.</p>

<p>But the written words, the written claim, roused in
her a swelling, choking anger.</p>

<p>She would not go away! She would stay and <i>fight</i>
that women to the death for her love!</p>

<p>Yet all the time she knew that she would go. It was
inevitable, as her heart had always somehow told her
that this hour would inevitably come.</p>

<p>Except for his broken promise&mdash;That was unanswerable&mdash;she
had no heart to blame Jimmie. She would
not go in anger. In her heart she had sworn that, if
this day should come, she would free him completely,
and without bitterness.</p>

<p>She was going.</p>

<p>Her love was spoiled, tarnished; another had touched
it. She could never again have the glory of it. Dear
heart of life, how beautiful it had been! And she must
go, lest in her weakness she should grovel and bring
that one beautiful thing of life down into dust with her.</p>

<p>As she passed the stable, Donahue whinnied lovingly
at the sound of her step. But she dared not stop. For
she knew that if she stopped now, and broke down and
cried with her pet and friend, the miserable end would
be that she would run to where Jimmie was and throw
herself on her knees to him and beg weakly for his love.
And&mdash;the shame of it!&mdash;he would talk, and talk, and
talk, and in the end she would live on with him, to hate
herself and him.</p>

<p>So her eyes were dry and her little shoulders bravely
set as she trudged on down through the fringe of trees
and into the brook path.</p>

<p>She did not know the cross-cuts by which Jimmie
went to the station every week&mdash;Oh yes, Jimmie went
to the station every week!&mdash;but she knew the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
fairly well. She would find it. She did not know
how many trains there were in the day, but she was
quite sure that there would be one before she could be
missed and overtaken. Jimmie had gone fishing for
the day.</p>

<p>Now this last thing one would rather not tell. Studied
design could not have found anything quite so cruel
to have done to her. It is, in fact, left for accident
and blind, silly coincidence to furnish the most terrible
thrusts of life. When Augusta came, still dry-eyed and
hurrying, down the dusty road to the little station,
she saw a man going away from the station and starting
across the fields. He did not see her.</p>

<p>It was Jimmie. He had not gone fishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>

<p>"Charles of Burgundy Comes, Thirteen Fifty-Eight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's a boob if he comes here!"</p>

<p>"That don't mean comes, you nut," some scholar
elucidated. "<i>Comes</i> means Duke. Charles, Duke of
Burgundy. He built the bridge."</p>

<p>"Wish t'ell he'd built it straight east and west."
Don Mallet threw down the thin stone tablet in disgust.
It had landed a moment before in the pit of his
stomach. A German shell exploding a little distance
on the other side of the bridge coping had gently lobbed
the stone plate out of the wall where it had rested four
and a half centuries and shied it playfully at Mallet
where he sat on the ground.</p>

<p>When Charles of Burgundy had his name cut in
that stone tablet and had it set in the bridge he did
not foresee Mallet, nor the need of a bridge running
east and west.</p>

<p>But Mallet was here, and fifteen others, all heartily
approving his wish for a slight change in the alignment
of the bridge, all except a German machine gunner
and an American corporal who lay head to head close
under the coping of the wall, with the body of a "pup"
tent stretched impartially over their heads, and who
did not care.</p>

<p>This party, with a lieutenant in command, had
crossed the river to the north side before dawn. Behind
them from the hills beyond the river the American
artillery, as fast as it could come up to the river brow,
was getting to work, firing high above this party and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
a score of other parties that had crossed the river in
the dark under orders to find cover and stay.</p>

<p>In the dark they had stumbled into a machine gun
position on this little bridge over the dry bed of a creek.
They had gone over the five-foot coping on their bellies,
their rifles with bayonets fixed swinging free in their
hands.</p>

<p>Of the five Germans who had been on the bridge
only the man now lying here unconscious had seen
the dawn come down the valley a few minutes later.
For, as Patsy Murtha had remarked:</p>

<p>"That Kamerad stuff's all right when you can see
what their hands are doin'. But, in the dark&mdash;!"</p>

<p>With the coming of the light five of the men had put
on the tunics and helmets of those who had lately held
the place and had stood about the guns, to show enemy
watchers on the slopes and in the gullies to the north
that things were quite as they should be, while the
remainder of the men hid themselves under the coping
of the bridge.</p>

<p>But the ruse did not avail them long. And this was
why Don Mallet was dissatisfied with the direction
of the bridge. If it had run more nearly east and west
they would have been invisible from a certain wooded
gully that cut down through the hill beyond the bridge
and which, as happened, lay directly in line with the
bridge.</p>

<p>The full light had revealed the men in American
uniforms strung along under the coping of the bridge.
What the German machine gunners in the gully thought
is not pertinent. A driving blast of wind swept across
the bridge propelled by a rain of machine gun bullets
which cleaned the bridge as swiftly as if a giant broom
were sweeping ants off it.</p>

<p>The five men on the bridge came tumbling over
the coping rolling the machine guns with them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
falling in grunting heaps among their friends. It seemed
that they were quite miraculously unscathed from the
blast which had driven them from the bridge. For
when they had gotten to sitting postures, the five, in
prompt concert, ripped off the German jackets, wadded
them into the helmets and shied the whole over the
bank down into the dry bed of the creek below the
bridge. That this action was not merely a matter of
sentiment was proven by the fact that the five immediately
pulled off their own clean American shirts and
began to shake and search them severely. These men
had not now for weeks lived in an established trench
or dugout. From away beyond the Ourcq to here,
above the Vesle, they had come foot by foot, always in
the open, drifting and seeping, drifting and seeping,
in and out among the rear lines of a foe who always
retreated yet who always kicked back murderously.
Sometimes they had fought as part of a battalion,
creeping in a long thin Indian file around a nest of
machine guns, dragging themselves prone through the
grass or the standing grain, until the line was near
enough to spring yelling upon the surrounded foe.
They had fought and drifted, singly, in squads, going
forward sometimes in dozens, dribbling back through
in twos and threes. They had learned to sleep behind
a fallen tree trunk with machine gun bullets sifting
above their noses. But for three blessed weeks they
had lived in the open, crossing running water every
day&mdash;and they were body clean! The five men were
at that moment more afraid of German lice than they
were of the wind of death that was driving over their
heads. All values are, of course, relative.</p>

<p>Sergeant Jimmie Wardwell, his body well hidden
by the deep foliage of the tree in which he had taken
his post, poked a long-nosed rifle out across a limb.
It was a hunting rifle that he had borrowed one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
two years ago from a Canadian named Bray Stewart,
a long-limbed fellow with a friendly grin, a gentle
gray eye, and an unconquerable obsession that this
war was a deer hunt. Stewart was irrevocably convinced
that if "they" really wanted to win the war
they had only to put enough North Ontario farmer
boys up in convenient trees and pot all the Germans
on earth, up to five hundred yards. He had a scheme
for making salt licks in No Man's Land.</p>

<p>But Stewart, Jock as they called him&mdash;all Stewarts
are called Jock, had been sent into the mud flats of
the upper Lys, where there were no trees, and where
the best possible shelter was a ditch two thirds full of
water. And Jock, on the very day when in mere discouragement
he had lent the long hunting rifle to
Wardwell&mdash;for what conceivable purpose the rifle had
either been borrowed or lent will never be known&mdash;Jock
that day inhaled some of the first poison gas which
the progressive Hun had used and Jock had lain face
down in his ditch and drowned.</p>

<p>Wardwell had taken this as a personal and gratuitous
injury. He had not known Jock very much, for Wardwell
had just come over from a training camp in
England and been filtered into Jock's company, while
Stewart had come over with the Canadian regiment
almost in the beginning. Jock was a veteran soldier of
nineteen, while Jimmie was green and a Yank to boot.
But Wardwell had listened respectfully to Jock's lies
about the hunting in the hills far up on the road to
Cobalt, where they saw snow ten months of every
year. And Jimmie had lied moderately and with good
judgment about the hunting in his own hills. They
had respected each other.</p>

<p>Since then Wardwell had kept the rifle by him, in
violation of the Articles of War, in more or less secret
defiance of barrack sergeants, against the expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
wishes of high and low command, and to the death of
many individual Germans who never saw him.</p>

<p>A tall German under officer strutted out from the
woody shelter of the gully between the hills and stood
boldly out on the slope. Evidently he thought that
he was out of effective range and he saw that his own
guns were not reaching the men strung under the
coping of the bridge. He must get a gun out on the
slope here where it could sweep the Americans where
they lay. His problem was as plain to his intended
victims as it was to himself. The boys were already
swinging their captured machine guns into line.</p>

<p>"Hold your cannon, till you need them," said the
lieutenant, speaking quietly from where he lay out in
the grass half way between the men and Wardwell's
tree. "If Heine'll just hold that pose for another couple
of seconds, Wardwell will&mdash;"</p>

<p>Wardwell did. Jock's long rifle grunted once. The
German put his hand up sharply to his throat, turned
half around, then gave a funny little attempt at a
jump sidewise, as though something had suddenly
risen in the path before him, and slid bumping down
into the grass.</p>

<p>Two German privates came out of the cover and
stood over the body of the fallen man. Wardwell held
his hand, while his companions below waited, understanding.
If these two had come out risking their
lives to drag a wounded officer to shelter he would not
shoot.</p>

<p>One of the men leaned down examining the prone
figure in the grass. He straightened up almost immediately
and made a deliberate kick at the body.
That officer was dead.</p>

<p>Not one man of those watching by the bridge offered
a word of comment. They had been daily, hourly,
learning strange things about this enemy as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
fought and followed him. But they had come to no
conclusions except the one safe one that Wardwell
presently punctuated.</p>

<p>The man who had taken a kick at the dead man now
stood with his legs straddled wide apart looking down
at the bridge. He did not seem to expect any danger,
and since Wardwell was using smokeless powder and
there was plainly no firing from the men who could be
seen it is quite possible that the German thought the
officer had been killed by a stray bullet from his own
side. When Wardwell fired again it seemed to the boys
in their eagerness that they could almost follow the
bullet in its course.</p>

<p>They could, in fact, only see that the man dropped
vertically like a stone dropping, but some one said
excitedly:</p>

<p>"Eight hundred feet and over, and a clean drill
between the eyes! that aint luck, that's hate."</p>

<p>"You've got good eyes if you can see all that,"
drawled a Yankee boy from northern New York. "But
he does seem to have a kind of a prejudice against the
Beerheads, at that."</p>

<p>"He aint like us here," explained a philosopher from
Glens Falls. "We come here to fight 'cause the
fightin's good here. But this Wardwell gent, he's seen
too much. He aint fightin' Germans now. He's executin'
them. He uses a rifle 'cause he can't get to 'em with a
rope."</p>

<p>The remaining German had started running for the
shelter of the ravine, but Wardwell's chance shot at the
moving target caught him in the hip and he tumbled
headlong down out of sight.</p>

<p>Wardwell had come far since a day long ago upon the
hills above the lake when he had drawn what he thought
was a perfect sight on a chipmunk's eyes at fifty feet
and had ruined a perfectly good sap bucket which hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
forgotten a good six feet below where the chipmunk had
been.</p>

<p>Developments soon showed what the officer had had
in mind when he came out on the slope of the hill. Sand
bags and stones began flying up out of the ravine until
they formed a respectable pile on the edge of the hill.
Behind these came loose dirt hastily shovelled over and
beginning to mark the line of a trench. The Germans
were burrowing into the side of the hill. They would
quickly run a shallow trench out along the slope of the
hill to a point fifty feet or so in the open, from which
point, when they had dragged a heavy machine gun to
it, they could sweep the Americans from where they lay
under the wall of the little bridge.</p>

<p>The boys quickly trained the captured guns upon
the moving line of dirt where it seemed as though a big
mole was nosing his way along the face of the hill. But
the elevation was sharply against them, and the lieutenant
saw that they were hitting nothing for there was no
mark above the dirt.</p>

<p>"Save your ammunition," he commanded, "and
cover up the guns. They might be handy if we had to
come back this way in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Put the two wounded men under the bridge and
take cover in the creek bed."</p>

<p>The two men were quickly eased down into the dry
water course under the bridge and left as comfortable as
was possible, while the lieutenant called up to Wardwell:</p>

<p>"We'll have to depend on you for a lookout, Wardwell.
They might try to rush the creek from above or
below. Though I don't think the outfit across there is
anxious to rush anything this way. Stay where you are
while you can. But if you think they've spotted you,
make your rush for the creek bed. Don't stay if it should
become&mdash;useless."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
"'Right, Sir,'" said Wardwell, smiling to himself
among the leaves. He knew that the young officer had
started to say: "Don't stay if it should become too hot
for you." But he was getting used to the way they
thought of him and spoke to him. It had started with
the boys. They were Irish descent, most of these with
whom he had been through these weeks, and, what
was worse, they had been brigaded in with an old Irish
regiment in the British army early in the summer.
What their own ready working imagination had not
taught them, about war and its superstitions and its
queer and unreadable chances, the Irish had supplied
to them. One thing which the Irish had taught them
came under the category 'important, if true.' It was
founded on the well known fact that a man born to be
hanged will never be drowned. Every man, it appeared,
had a certain number fixed to him by fate. It represented
the number of chances which were his against
death, the number of times that he might face death
front to front and escape. Some men had only a few
chances, and a man might lose out on even the first of
his chances. Others had many. But every time a man
went through a desperate action he used one of his
chances of escape. But there were certain men who
had used up all of their chances, who had reached the
very last number. And then, in this their last moment,
by some queer stumble of fate, they had been missed.
After that they were not merely safe, they were isolated.
Death fled from them. They could hunt death, and some
of them did&mdash;so the Irish said, but they could not
achieve it from human hands.</p>

<p>Wardwell, it was whispered among the boys with wise
nodding of heads, Wardwell was one of these. And
they counted the tale of the numbered chances that
he had used, until he had, somehow, missed the last
unfailing one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
After that, they said, he had no chance. And they
told of places where he had put himself in the path of
death, of how men had died in front of him and behind
him, how he had been shot through so many times that
now he hardly bled when wounded. This last was untrue,
of course. Many things that they told were over
drawn, as they would be. Most of the tales were inaccurate.
And, again as would happen, many of the
things were only half told.</p>

<p>So Wardwell understood, and smiled when he felt his
officer hesitate about naming the word danger to him.</p>

<p>He was partly Irish himself, and he knew that some
of the times when he had escaped death it had been
hardly short of miraculous. Also he knew that there
were other men in the armies who like himself had
lived through almost unbelievable numbers of chances
and that these were marked men who did not seem to
be able to die in battle.</p>

<p>For himself, however, he had no need of the theory
of chances which explained these things to the men.
He knew.</p>

<p>When the time should come, he would get his wound.
And the wound would bring death. But before death
could come he would see Augusta.</p>

<p>It was all simple, and as it had been ordained from
the beginning.</p>

<p>The trench along the face of the hill was all but complete
now, and at the end of it there grew a considerable
rounded pile of sand bags. There they were going to set
the gun. He saw signs of a movement along through
the trench, and knew that they were dragging a heavy
machine gun out to its place. A head and part of a
shoulder came up momentarily above the line of dirt.
Wardwell had his sight upon it but he did not try the
difficult shot. He must give them time to get busy with
the gun, and to grow careless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
No, there was nothing left to chance, or to any number
of chances. Everything that had happened, and
that was happening and going to happen, moved into
place as the result of something that had gone before,
as inevitably as one pebble is moved by the pressure of
another pebble.</p>

<p>In his ignorance&mdash;it is only in ignorance that the
fatal things are done, malice is not cunning enough&mdash;he
had committed the one unforgivable sin. He had taken
money from one woman to give to another.</p>

<p>He had not known at the time that it was the unpardonable
sin. He had not, as he remembered it now,
thought of anything except that he could not stand
Augusta's grief for the loss of her horse. To get her pet
back for her at that time he would have taken money
from anybody.</p>

<p>It was true enough that the other woman had owed
him the money in an entirely business-like way. He
had loaned her the money at a time when she needed it.</p>

<p>Afterwards she had married a wealthy man. Several
times when they had met she had laughingly tried to
pay him back his loan, but he had always talked her
around the matter, and later he had dropped out of
her sight into the seclusion of Rose Wilding's house to
make his fight for his book and a reputation.</p>

<p>That morning when he had seen Augusta grieving in
the empty stable, and after he had talked with Jethniah,
he had gone down to the station and sent the telegram
to the woman saying simply that he needed the money
and asking for it.</p>

<p>He had had no misgiving that he was doing anything
that would ever hurt Augusta. He had thought no more
of the matter than if he had been asking any man for the
return of a loan at need.</p>

<p>The trouble was that the woman was discontented in
marriage&mdash;as she would have been discontented in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
singleness, or discontented in jail, or discontented in
what was her idea of heaven. She was looking for diversion,
and her discontent took the form of imagining herself
to be sadly and irretrievably in love with Wardwell.
(If she had been obliged to live two weeks in a cabin
with him she would have come to the point of murdering
him.)</p>

<p>Not long after he had sent the telegram and received
his money Jimmie had begun to be troubled with a
sharp premonition of something wrong. Something was
brewing up for him somewhere. He was quick to understand
that the one contact which he had established
with the world without was probably the source of his
worry. He mooned around for a day or so, waiting for
something to drop, as he put it to himself. Then he
went fearfully down to the station.</p>

<p>There were six letters waiting for him.</p>

<p>He read the last first. It seemed that the woman had
somehow learned that Wardwell had gone away sick.
From the last of the letters he gathered that she had
pictured him to herself as lying penniless and alone,
and at the point of death, somewhere in the woods, and
that she was about to fly to him. She was capable of
doing it, he knew.</p>

<p>With the choking, hopeless feeling of a man being
drowned, he wondered if she had already started. In
his panic he telegraphed:</p>

<p><i>Do not come. Am leaving here.</i></p>

<p>No sooner was the wire gone than he repented the
last words of it. Why had he lied? He should not have
lied, for it would only lead to other lies. The woman
was one to revel in mysteries, and his evading her now
would merely determine her to come and search him
out. He was not going away from here, and he should
not have lied to say so. Now he would have to write, at
once, and take back the lie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Then and there he borrowed paper and wrote. He
told her, circumstantially, that he was in perfect
health. He explained that he and his wife&mdash;the woman
evidently had not thought of the possibility of his being
married&mdash;were living away up here in the woods in
order that they might be able to go on with their writing
without interruptions. He apologized abjectly for
having annoyed her. He hoped that she would remember
that only a temporary and acute crisis had made
him trouble her, and at the same time he hoped that she
would forget the whole matter.</p>

<p>The letter was so unlike his usual clear handed
methods that he felt sure the lady would either think
him deranged or that she would disbelieve the whole of
it. But he sent the letter. At any rate he must try to
keep her from coming here.</p>

<p>Then he started home to Augusta, dragging with
him a weight of hang-dog misery that increased at
every step.</p>

<p>Never had Augusta's sweetness and the dear simple
beauty of her faith in him been so precious to him as in
those minutes. He hated the other woman unreasoningly,
viciously; and yet more he hated himself, because,
somehow, he seemed to have thrown a slur upon
Augusta. That day, when her heart was high and sweet
with its sacrifice for him, he had forced her, in some
shameful way it seemed, to take something&mdash;money
in fact&mdash;which he had taken from another woman.</p>

<p>He knew, even in that walk home, that he had done a
fatal thing. And the anxieties and the nightmares of
the winter that followed came upon him inexorably and
without surprise.</p>

<p>In alternate letters, and often alternately in the same
letter, the other woman upbraided him for having deceived
her, in being married, and being well, and on the
other hand vowed that she did not believe a word of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
what he told her but was sure that he was there sick
and alone and that she must come to see.</p>

<p>Through all that winter and into the spring he lived
under the constant dread that the woman might come,
and he was obliged to answer every letter, profusely and
carefully, lest something which he omitted to answer
might give her the impulse that would bring her flying
to find him. That the whole business was melodramatic,
and entirely foolish, did not lighten the matter in the
least. And at all times he was convinced with a miserable
dull certainty that all he did was useless. Augusta
would inevitably come to know, anyhow. He had never
expected to be able to hide anything from her. He had
sworn that he never would have anything to hide from
her. He was certain that she would come to know of this,
and in the most shameful and pitiless way. He had no
hope that it would be otherwise.</p>

<p>Even now, as he watched the German gun being
poked into its place above the line of the dirt on the far
hillside, he shuddered at the humiliation and the
ignominy of that winter. Augusta had known that there
was something wrong. She had, of course, seen it in his
eyes and sensed it in the air about him, from the very
beginning. But he had never been able to tell her. He
knew Augusta's peculiar jealousy. It was not the usual
property-holding interest by which the average woman
clings to her rights in a man, because she is afraid of the
consequences of letting him slip away from her.</p>

<p>Augusta was in this, as in so many things, different
from any woman whom Wardwell had ever known or
imagined. Like all people that live a great deal within
themselves, the things that were her own, even the
little things, had a sacred and a touching value to
Augusta. If a thing was not entirely her own she did not
care for it at all. She wanted nothing near her that she
had to share in any way with another person. Wardwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
remembered that she had once given away her best
coat because another girl had put it on herself just for a
moment to see how she would look in it. And as for the
loaf of her love, so far from being able to think of sharing
it with anyone, he knew that the thought that another
had even looked at it would be enough to spoil it for
Augusta.</p>

<p>And he, with this full knowledge of her fiercely
proud little heart, had brought another woman in to
despoil the sacred shrine of Augusta's love. He knew
that she had thanked him for getting her pet back for
her as the dearest thing he had ever done for her. And
now when she should come to know the truth&mdash;as she
would&mdash;it would embitter her to know that she owed
it to another woman.</p>

<p>As the letters continued to come and the worry and
humiliation of keeping up what seemed like an intrigue
grew upon him he moodily wished that Augusta might
learn the truth.</p>

<p>He could not tell her, for the very fact that must be
his excuse, that he had done what he did for the love
of her, would be the very reason why Augusta would
resent his going to another woman. Explanations were
always useless to Augusta. She cared not at all for the
details. She would understand instantly, he thought,
and understand more justly than he could tell her.
But she would be mortally hurt.</p>

<p>It did not occur to him that Augusta would be just
like every other woman. He never thought that Augusta
in the supreme test when her love was threatened,
would lose her almost inspired insight and go blind to
everything except the one condemning fact&mdash;that he
was corresponding secretly with another woman.</p>

<p>When the end came, when he came home that day
to learn that Augusta had left him, and to read her
note with its stark and yet prophetic finality, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
stunned by this thing which he had expected least
of all.</p>

<p>The first emotion that he remembered was a furious
anger with Augusta. It seemed that she had read but a
part of one of the letters and had immediately jumped
to the worst of conclusions. He was angry with Augusta,
he remembered now, not because she had gone,
but because she had allowed herself to be stupid.</p>

<p>How could she have misunderstood? Why should
she have misjudged him so? She must have been deliberately
blind, for Augusta had not only an unerring
instinct for truth she had also a keenness of judgment
such as he had hardly ever seen in man or woman.</p>

<p>But that was all very, very long ago, and he scarcely
remembered now the boyish rage in which he had
raved and had torn the hated letters and stamped
them into the floor of the cabin.</p>

<p>He had chased feverishly to New York after her,
and he had walked the city, without a starting point
and without direction, looking for her, as he and she
together had once walked the streets looking for Rose
Wilding. Then, when at last he had become convinced
that it was useless, that he would never find Augusta
until the time that she should choose, he had gone
back to the lake, to the Hills of Desire, to wait for her.</p>

<p>He found Donahue browsing contentedly among
the trees much as he had left him, and a world mockingly
unchanged.</p>

<p>Of course, he could not stay there. The haunting,
whispering sweetness of Augusta's presence was there
at every turn of his eyes, in the breath of every breeze
that brushed his cheek, in the song of every bird that
piped. There memories choked him, of the nights when
she had fought the fever with him, of days when their
hearts had danced together in the joy of work. There
he had learned why the human race continues to wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
to live&mdash;he had learned to know a sweet woman's
heart.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day he went down to
the station and bought a ticket for Montreal. The
station agent-postmistress told him with a simper that
there were letters for him.</p>

<p>"Will you please keep them," Wardwell requested
politely, "until I call on my way back. I&mdash;I might lose
them."</p>

<p>The next day he was a member of a Canadian infantry
regiment, on his way to an assembling camp.</p>

<p>Through two years he had lived and fought, as other
men lived and fought. He had lain sick and had thirsted
and despaired, as other men did; and he had seen how
other men died. About the last matter he was not
surprised, except at the unwinking simplicity of it.</p>

<p>A man stood beside you and asked for a chew of
tobacco. The next time you looked at him he was a
corpse, to be buried at once&mdash;if there was time. A
man ran shouting by your side, and passed you, perhaps,
and when you caught up with him he was dead.
And they went out so untragically true to their ruling
habit and disposition. A talkative man died talking.
A quiet man turned his head from you and died his
own way.</p>

<p>They had been sickening years, those two years
when the claws of the Beast were at the throat of the
world. And there had been many times when Wardwell,
in the spirit weariness which every good man
felt sooner or later, would have been willing to lie down
and ask for death, saying that he had done his share.
But death had not come for him, and his mind had
turned definitely back and rested with conviction on
the sentence which Augusta had written for him. They
were not to have this life together, but he would not
go from here until he had seen her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
The sense of injury and misunderstanding which he
had at first nursed had drifted away. Neither did he
feel any of the self blame with which he had loaded
himself in the beginning. Augusta had not done this
thing to them. Neither had his foolish doing effected it.
Destiny working with its dull tool, chance, was fashioning
out their lives. He did not understand. But it seemed
that Augusta understood. So, then, he should not go
until he heard her voice calling him.</p>

<p>Then there had come the long looked for call of his
own country. He had gone gladly back across the ocean
and they had at once given him work in the training
of student officers. He gave no thought to the commission
which might have been his for the asking. He
was not looking for the high adventure of war as these
boys and men strained toward it. He was heartily
sick of war and all that went with it. He had come
back to help raise the posse which would put the ramping
Beast in pound. When that should be done, and
he knew that it would be done quickly and properly,
his work would be finished. But first he would see
Augusta.</p>

<p>He had submitted to his loss of Augusta much as a
maimed man submits to the loss of a member. He could
undoubtedly live on without Augusta. But it is years
before a man, who has, for instance, lost a right arm,
can remember that the arm is no longer there. He was
forever turning to her mentally, and in every crowded
street he saw the sweet girlish figure of Augusta just
slipping from sight away from him. He had submitted
passively to the decree of fate, or whatever it was that
had taken her from him, but the living delight of her
presence never left him. It was not memory, nor, in
any sense, imagination. It was a fact. In those wonderful
months which they had had together, Augusta had
not merely lived with him. She had so lived herself into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
his life that she had become an indefinable, but vital,
part of the being that was called Jimmy Wardwell.
Without her this Wardwell did not exist.</p>

<p>It was out of this feeling of Augusta's persisting presence
with him that there grew up in him a conviction.</p>

<p>Sometimes it seemed mere impudence. Again it
seemed entirely reasonable&mdash;reasonable and possible
only, of course, in connection with Augusta.</p>

<p>He remembered the night when he had lain out
alone in a shell hole at Messines. He was wounded in
the chest and there was no hope of help coming to
him. He could feel the life running out of him, as one
after another of the conscious and unconscious grips
of life slipped away from him. He was dying, so it was
plain. But even as he was coming to that point where
he finally surrendered consciousness, he was aware of
a force of life within him which was not being dimmed.
That part of him which he had come to think of as
being of Augusta, that much of him was still living
and untouched by death. It was not that he dreamed
Augusta there with him. Nor did his groping senses
conjure up for him a vision of her. She was there, in
him, a living part <span id="of">of him</span>, which did not and would
not die.</p>

<p>From that night he had known that he would not
die so long as Augusta lived.</p>

<p>But his thought sometimes went further than this.
At the oddest moments, often when hands and body
and brain were busiest with the surface of things, more
than once when he was actually fighting for his life,
there had come to him a flash of something&mdash;he did
not know whether it was of foreknowledge or of crazy
presumption. But it came to him.</p>

<p>Might it not be that Augusta and he were actually
coming to the adventure of death together&mdash;to <i>survive</i>
it!&mdash;to hold to each other <i>beyond</i> it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
If he had believed that the thought was his own,
he would have given it no heed. But he was sure that
it was not his own. Augusta had given it to him. Of
that much he was sure. And in that much he did not
reject it.</p>

<p>For himself, out of his own experiences, he had seen
the chemistry of death setting to work upon the cooling
bodies of men in so many ways, in such varied circumstances,
and yet always with such unfailing method
and matter-of-factness, that he had never seen any
reason to believe in the survival of anything beyond it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Augusta had given him the thought.</p>

<p>In the days which he had spent in New York he had
looked every moment for Augusta. But when he had
stood one day upon the Avenue and had scanned the
marching of five thousand girl nurses who were preparing
for their work in the train of war, and had not
seen Augusta among them, he was convinced that
she was not in the country. He was right, for Augusta
was already in France.</p>

<p>Since he had come back now to what he felt was
the business of concluding the war, he was sure that
Augusta was nearer to him than she had been since
that day when she left him in the hills. Day and night,
whether in fighting or in dead sleep, he could feel her
presence with him.</p>

<p>Sometimes she was as poignantly real to him, and
as reassuring, as on the long-ago nights in the wagon
and in the sugar hut when he used to wake up and
listen for her breathing. But there was no illusion in
this feeling of her nearness. He knew that Augusta was
not really there with him. She was, he had no doubt,
though he had not so much as heard her name mentioned,
behind these lines somewhere doing the work
that came to her. Yet there were times when his head
would go up, one ear cocked up in the old way, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
a quick little grin would run across his face, as though
he had just thought of something to tell her that would
make her laugh.</p>

<p>In the last three weeks Jimmy's feeling that Augusta
was living in his life, in every moment of the day's work,
had been growing so strong that he knew it could not
go on. The end must be near. He would soon see Augusta.
He began to look for it hourly.</p>

<p>It was peculiar that he now no longer thought of
the original cause of his losing Augusta. War and life
had ground all that away. He knew that he would find
Augusta looking only to the future. They would keep
only the memory of those months of dear love that
they had lived together. Their work which they had
loved with their souls, the dreams which they had had
together, even these things were of the past, and done
with.</p>

<p>Wardwell knew that, left to himself, his mind would
have thought only of going back&mdash;when this was over&mdash;and,
with Augusta, trying to rebuild and live in the
home of dreams that had been their house of love in
the Hills of Desire. But Augusta never went back.
She was too vital. She was too much like life itself.</p>

<p>If he was to have Augusta, to be with her, he must
go on.</p>

<p>He was coming swift to the Great Adventure. He
could feel the pulse of his being rising to it.</p>

<p>He did not fear, for he believed that now Augusta
wanted him. And if her eyes saw a light through the
dropping darkness, then it was a true light. He had only
to stumble after.</p>

<p>So he smiled contentedly at the young officer's hesitation
in speaking to him of danger, and at the foolish
theories of the men regarding his life.</p>

<p>Augusta had always had her will.</p>

<p>Then he happened to remember&mdash;for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in many months&mdash;that book which had once seemed
more to him than life or death. In New York the publishers
had told him that it had done well, considering
war times and all other things it had done very well.
The royalties, they said, they were still holding, because
up to that time they had not been able to locate
Augusta, to whom he had assigned the ownership of
the book three years ago. He had merely told them to
keep on looking for her.</p>

<p>Still smiling, he wished that he and Augusta might
have just one good picnic on those spoiling royalties.</p>

<p>From behind the little mound of dirt on the hillside
the machine gun was dripping a line of bullets along the
wall where the Americans had been. There was nobody
there, but the German gunner was not yet convinced
of that. A gentle, steady breeze was coming down from
the slope, clearing the light smoke from the machine
gun nests and rolling it slowly down toward the dry
creek bed and the bridge. Wardwell thus had a perfect
view of the ravine.</p>

<p>But the enemy was cautious. Not a head nor even a
hand showed above the line of dirt along the face of the
hill. Wardwell searched the ravine itself. A bush in the
midst of the dark green centre of the ravine seemed to
be moving about grotesquely. Wardwell, over his sights,
watched it sharply, until his eyes and his imagination
working together resolved it into its component parts.
It was a man with green branches tied all about him,
and he was tugging a heavy machine gun into a new
position.</p>

<p>The effect of his shot gave Wardwell a thorough surprise.
Not only did the man with the branches tied
about him disappear, but what had seemed to be an
almost solid hedge of green shrubs across the mouth
of the ravine fell away instantly, revealing some bare
rocks and two guns. Wardwell mentally rubbed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
eyes and stared. There must, before, have been at least
three or four men standing about the guns and all
draped in heavy bushes.</p>

<p>As he watched, one of the guns began to fire again,
though he could not see the hands that managed it,
and a sudden flutter of twigs and leaves came pattering
down upon his head. They had guessed him out in his
tree.</p>

<p>He shifted his position to get the full protection of the
body of the tree, and gave his attention to the lone gun
out on the hill. He would like to put that gun out of
working, not because it was doing any harm just now,
but because of what might have to be done later. He
watched patiently for several minutes, while the gun
in the ravine continued to trim the little branches from
his tree, but it did not seem that he would get a chance.
The fellow in the ditch was keeping entirely under
cover and working his gun with a stubborn fixity of
idea against the line of the bridge wall.</p>

<p>The sputtering explosion of a soft shell on the bridge
startled Wardwell. Now if the Germans had found the
creek bed with gas&mdash;and, of course, they had every
range studied down to a matter of feet&mdash;then there was a
bad time ahead. He waited while another shell fell into
the creek bed below the bridge and another dropped
down in front of him right near where the two wounded
men had been placed. The foul poison was practically
colorless, but, immediately, he could see the little green
tufts of grass in the creek bed withering to death.</p>

<p>He slid to the ground and made a low running dive
down the bank of the creek. The lieutenant was already
giving orders to get the two men up from the bed of the
creek and to make holes for them in the top of the bank
on the north side. Wardwell saw that the lieutenant
had taken his decision. They could not stay here. The
creek bed would soon fill with gas. If they were to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
back, they must go at once, across the half mile of open
field between them and the river. They must carry at
least one wounded man, and, from the elevation, those
machine guns could follow them every inch of the way.
What was worse, the gas would soon fill the creek bed
and then the wind coming down from the hill would
carry it back so that it would follow them to the
river.</p>

<p>Well, they were not going back. Or at least, Wardwell
judged from the lieutenant's dispositions, they were not
going back until they had made a try for those machine
guns.</p>

<p>Three minutes later they were all strung out just on
the edge of the upper bank, with intervals of about
fifty feet between them, their bodies curled up tight for a
spring, their eyes fixed on the spitting guns up the hill
before them. The two hundred and fifty yards of sloping
hillside looked as smooth and bare as the top of a
slightly tilted table. There did not seem to be a hollow
anywhere in it, not as much as the suggestion of a furrow,
into which a man might drop for breath and an
instant's respite in his rush up toward those guns.</p>

<p>They were stripped of everything except their rifles
and the one or two bombs that each man could carry
in his rush. They had not needed details of instruction.
They had done this thing before.</p>

<p>A man rose silently from the edge of the bank. It
was the young lieutenant himself. He did not stand
poised, or look at his men. He came up running, and
shot forward with that peculiar, side-wheeling motion
that many men acquire from running with a foot ball
under one arm while warding off tacklers with the other
arm stiff. He ran with his pistol clutched stiffly in his
right hand, his other arm curled in against his side.
Fifty, sixty, seventy feet he drove on, running low and
pigeon-toed, always with that wheeling motion, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the machine guns dropped their other marks and turned
their blazing eyes on him.</p>

<p>Before the lieutenant had dropped safe into a little
depression of the slope, another man was shooting forward
away out on the right. Then another, below the
bridge, scooted ahead, dodging along in a way that was
his own. Man after man rose running, dove forward for
about the length of five seconds&mdash;a hundred feet
maybe&mdash;then dropped flat into anything that looked
like a slight protection.</p>

<p>There were no signals, no commands, no noise. It was
a game which each man played in his own way. A simple
game with only two rules: First, they must not bunch
together; second, no man should be last&mdash;there must
not be any last man.</p>

<p>Saving these two rules, they went forward, each in his
own way, each playing out his own hand with death.</p>

<p>Some ran straight, their heads down, their eyes half
shut, thinking only of speed. Others ran zig-zagging and
dodging as though they were picking their way, although
there was no cover at all and no choice of a way.</p>

<p>To the watching foe, who did not even now dare to
raise his head above the ground line, there seemed to be
not more than three or four men coming up the slope.
Of course it was puzzling that those three or four should
be able to be continuously popping up at so many
different places of a long line. There must be more than
that number of men. But there was no way of telling
how many. And that, of course, was the reason for the
apparently haphazard manner of the rush.</p>

<p>Wardwell, at the extreme right of the uneven line,
ran forward with longer sprints than was possible for
the men near the middle of the line. In comparison with
those others he was reasonably safe out here. His part
would come later when, having gotten beyond the line of
the machine guns, he must circle down upon them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
shooting and bombing and yelling while the men in
front made the final rush.</p>

<p>He was not often excited now in this business, which
had come to be to him merely the day's work. But,
running up the hill, he felt a strange and wonderful
tingle of excitation of spirit. Something was waiting for
him at the end of this run. He was suddenly as sure as he
had ever in his life been sure of anything that this was
his last fight.</p>

<p>He felt the breath of bullets driving by near his head
and dropped, mechanically obedient to his training. But
he was up again in a moment and running madly.</p>

<p>Now he was up to the line of the single gun that had
been placed out on the hill. But his business was not
with that gun. He must run clear over the brow of the
hill and get down into the ravine before the boys in
front were ready to run straight upon the guns.</p>

<p>He was running wildly now, his body and his spirit
strangely lifted with the sense that the Great Adventure
was right ahead. It was not the eagerness of battle
nor the fever of fighting that ran in his blood. He knew
that he was coming to the break in the wall, beyond
which lay the Undiscovered Country&mdash;so Augusta was
whispering to him.</p>

<p>From the edge of the ravine he saw below him ten or a
dozen men lying and working at the three machine
guns. Out in the open he saw the broken line of his own
fellows. There was the young lieutenant lying flat,
wriggling along the ground by inches, and digging impatiently
with his toe. They were ready.</p>

<p>Across the space, on the other side of the ravine,
there came running a youngster whom the boys called
"Watertown"&mdash;he was forever talking about the place.
He came running to the farther edge of the ravine,
swinging his bomb.</p>

<p>Wardwell flung his first bomb down into the cluster of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
guns and men, and leaped sliding, stumbling, falling
down the crumbling bank.</p>

<p>Half way down he caught his balance, lay back a
little, and steadied himself to throw the other bomb.
Then without looking to see the effect he gripped his
rifle, and yelling madly leaped down towards the guns.</p>

<p>Five seconds later he was lying quietly against the
gravel of the bank. There was a hideous commotion
going on about him, but he did not mind it. There was a
sharp pain&mdash;it felt like a burn&mdash;in his throat, and he
seemed to have trouble breathing. But it did not seem
to matter. He was going to sleep anyway.</p>

<p>And then, presently, he would see Augusta. And then
he smiled to himself. Augusta had always had her will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X</h2>

<p>When Wardwell awoke he was petulantly disappointed.
He was not quite clear as to what he had expected,
but that he should be awakened by the old
hated smell of anesthetics was a distinct injury.</p>

<p>He did not feel any immediate physical discomfort,
but he knew that this was only because his body had
not yet begun to wake up. There were even now vague
nerve stirrings in various scattered places through his
body, though not connected with each other nor,
directly, with him. He knew that these sensations would
soon begin to link up with each other, and then they
would connect up with him. Presently torture would
begin. He knew the whole business. He had watched the
process before, and he cringed at its advance.</p>

<p>He felt like a boy who has been cheated of some
wonderful promised adventure which he had been just
about to begin. He was lonely, and he had been cheated,
and if he tried to make the slightest move now somebody
would come and begin to poke at him. Why
couldn't they leave him alone? He wanted to cry.</p>

<p>And yet there was a sort of elusive contentment about
this place&mdash;he did not know where or what the place
was, and did not care&mdash;some kind of a pleasant memory,
as though some one had been here. He thought he
could dream here&mdash;if only they would not come poking
at him. Maybe he had been dreaming. He could not
remember.</p>

<p>There had once been a little white room somewhere.
He could not remember where, but it did not matter.
Augusta was in the little white room. In fact the
little white room and Augusta were much the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
thing. You could not seem to see one without the
other.</p>

<p>Why should he think of that little white room and
Augusta here? Had Augusta been here? Somehow it
seemed like a place where Augusta had just been.
That was a funny thing to think of, but that was true
about Augusta. He remembered how she had only to be
a moment in a room, or any place, and when she went
away you could know that Augusta had been there.
There was a blessedness, some sort of a happy sweetness,
that always came with her and which you could
feel after she was gone.</p>

<p>It was strange that he should feel that haunting,
ethereal presence of her here. It had never deceived him
before. Could it be coming here to mock him now? That
would be too much!</p>

<p>If he could only get back to sleep before they came
to poke at him, maybe they would leave him alone,
and&mdash;maybe he could dream. He must have been
dreaming of Augusta.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Augusta had been in that place,
in that room but a moment or two before. Perhaps some
tone of her voice had touched something in Wardwell's
numb brain and had waked him slowly.</p>

<p>She had not seen him. There was no good reason
why she should go near him or see him. He was just one
of twenty-five or thirty variously wrapped bundles
that had just come down from the field stations, each
containing a man. So long as the man slept after the
jolting and the fainting fatigue of the journey, he need
not be disturbed.</p>

<p>So Augusta had gone on about her affairs. For she was
a very busy woman in a very busy place.</p>

<p>Now she was slowly following a surgeon as he worked
his way down a long line of cots, stopping at each one
to inspect the bandages which had been loosened by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
nurse going before, giving instruction for the washing
of a wound where he found that necessary, placing a
few swift stitches where the condition of a cut or an
open wound demanded, probing sharply and directly
with never an unnecessary touch, a man who did three
days' work in every one of his days, and often as much
more in one of his nights, with a steady temper and a
will that procreated discipline and swift service in
those about him. He was a middle sized man with
Scotch gray eyes, a short gray mustache, very small
feet, and excessively large hands whose bones had
been overdrawn by hard, grubbing work in his youth
on a Maine farm. He was short and blunt of word as
most strong men will be when they are putting the
best of their lives into the strokes of their day's work.
But he was sensitive as a cat or a bird to anything
unusual in the air about him. He repeated with unvarying
distinctness the few clear orders at the end of
each examination, assuming as bluntly as if Augusta
had been an echo, or an adding machine, that she
heard correctly, that she wrote the instructions properly
and that she took each page from her pad and stuck
it on the chart at the head of each bed. She was there
for that purpose, just like the rest of his instruments.
But there was something about this girl today that
seemed to be speaking. It was not speaking to him
particularly, but to all the world that had the sense to
understand. There was a persistent breath of happiness
about her that was as patent as sunshine yet as elusive
as a perfume in a dream.</p>

<p>After he had finished with the last of the row of men,
he stopped in the act of drying his hands and looked
quizzically at her. He remembered that yesterday and
the day before he had seen in this girl's eyes a peculiar,
strained, listening look, as though she were trying to
see something or maybe hear something outside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
range of ordinary senses. He had seen that the girl had
been laboring under some terrifying anxiety, but, as
it had not affected the mechanical perfection of her
work, and certainly was not connected with the work,
he had said nothing. Now as he saw the quiet loveliness
of some assured happiness in her face, he said:</p>

<p>"Young lady, what wonderful thing have you been
seeing, since yesterday?"</p>

<p>Augusta looked up at him in startled wonder, but
she did not evade or ask him what he meant. She told
him the simple truth, so that he might make what he
would of it.</p>

<p>"It isn't anything that I've <i>seen</i>. It's just something
that I <i>know</i>."</p>

<p>"Um-hum," agreed the doctor cordially. "Very
satisfactory, I'm sure. And very illuminating."</p>

<p>He turned and went out of the ward door into the
sunshine of the hot afternoon. Crossing the wide open
court where the great red cross was painted on the
hard whitewashed surface of the ground, he reflected
that, whereas most women would have smiled and
evaded and offered some subterfuge and he could then
have guessed the facts to a practical certainty, this girl
had probably spoken the precise truth&mdash;leaving him exactly
as wise as he had been before asking.</p>

<p>Augusta, walking slowly back to the head of the line,
wondered, smiling, just what the doctor would have
said if she had really told him what she meant. She
had spoken the literal truth, but it was very far from
being what he would have thought truth.</p>

<p>Two days before she had caught a glimpse of Jimmie
Wardwell lying with his head thrown back against a
bank of stones and earth. And she had seen a great,
gaping wound at the base of his throat where his shirt
had been torn open. It was but an instant flash of vision
that had come to her while she was in the act of writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
a letter for a wounded man. The man had stopped for
a moment, waiting to think of the next thing to be said
in the letter. And while she sat waiting with her writing
hand suspended over the paper she had looked straight
at the dirty, streaked side of a ravine, and there was
Jimmie lying there with a trace of a tired but triumphant
little laugh on his face. Even in the instant she was
sure that she saw him tremble and quiver back against
the bank, as though death were striking.</p>

<p>Then the voice of the man on the cot beside her
went on slowly&mdash;the letter was to his younger brother
at home:</p>

<p>"Tell Mom not to bother any more with sweaters,
we'll all be home for Christmas anyway."</p>

<p>Augusta's poised hand fell mechanically to the
paper and began to write.</p>

<p>She had seen no more. All that day and yesterday
she had strained at the windows of her soul, praying
and striving to catch again a sight of her loved one.
But there had come to her nothing but a cold, terrifying
conviction that Jimmie was dead. It must be that
he was dead, for if he were alive she was sure that she
could make him know that she was crying to him, and
she would be able to see him.</p>

<p>Through two days of heart agony she had walked
and worked, her body and her outward mind responding
capably to the demands of each minute, while her
own inner being struggled with the desperation of
death, to free itself from the limitations of the senses,
so that it might find its mate. But, though her soul
had cried and fought and suffered until it seemed that
she herself must die, there had come to her vision
nothing but the black wall of death.</p>

<p>Jimmie was dead. There was a corpse lying out
somewhere under a bank&mdash;maybe the dirt had rolled
down over it now&mdash;and that was the end. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
nothing more. The black conviction of despair, of hope
dead and buried, settled down upon her. Her love was
dead. This world was empty, and there was no other.</p>

<p>Late at night, lying alone in her little wood-walled
room over in the nurses' pavilion, writhing in her pain,
Augusta had spoken aloud.</p>

<p>"You fooled me, God," she said bitterly. "You
taught me to believe. And there is nothing&mdash;<i>nothing</i>."</p>

<p>But the sound of her own voice in the uninterested
darkness had turned her thought back to her self. She
had only herself to blame. She had cheated herself.
She had built up for herself a dream. How could she
complain that she should not find it to be only a dream?</p>

<p>Three years ago, on that hideous last day in the
little house among the trees in the Hills of Desire, she
had stood looking at a scattered bundle of letters, and
she had seen a glimpse of a woman's face, a dark, discontented,
attractive face.</p>

<p>At that moment there had come into her mind, full
formed, the thought that had been the key to her
action and to the words that she had written on the
typewriter for Jimmie.</p>

<p>She did not know whether Jimmie loved this woman.
She did not greatly believe that he did. But it had come
to her that her love was spoiled even by the thought
that that other woman had looked at it. There was
not room for her love in the same world where that
other woman lived. Augusta could not share her love
loaf even so much as to have it in the same world where
there was another who thought greedily upon it.</p>

<p>Out of that thought had grown the conviction which
she had written in the line to Jimmie. For this life their
love had been spoiled. They were not to have it.</p>

<p>But as she still stood there a whisper had come to
her&mdash;she had never thought to question whence it
came&mdash;a clear, flashing, fearful hope had come to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Jimmie and she might not live this life together. But
one day&mdash;the sweet hope sang high to her heart&mdash;Jimmie
and she, they two, would take the road together,
the road that led through the Curtain to the
Great Adventure in the Hills of All Desire.</p>

<p>She had lived through the years on the breath of
that whisper which had come to her. She had believed
in it as a promise. She had kept it in her heart. Only
in the very secretest of her communings with the Jimmie
to whom her heart constantly talked had she told it
to him.</p>

<p>She had hardly put her thought into words, but it
was a part of her faith in love. She would not believe
that love like hers could die. She did not know how, or
in what terms, but she was sure that, somehow, she
and Jimmie would find the broken line of love and go
on with it.</p>

<p>It had seemed so simple, when it was not near. She
had all the time been sure that when Jimmie was ready
to go&mdash;she had not thought that it would be very
long&mdash;then she would know it, and she would be ready
to go with him.</p>

<p>Many times in the three years she had known when
Jimmie was in danger. Twice she had seen his name
among Americans wounded with the Canadians. But
she had not needed that outward evidence. She had
often been able to call him and to feel his response.
Though she had never before been able to see him, she
had at all times known that he was living and going on.</p>

<p>And lately she had become almost bold. She had
felt the coming of what was to be the great moment.
She thought that she had felt the shadow of the wings
of death&mdash;and she was not afraid. She believed that
Jimmie would soon be taking the road into the Beyond&mdash;and
she grew almost openly confident that she was
going with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
She had lived on the very tip of every moment.
With a strange defiance of reality, she, a soundly
healthy young woman&mdash;not knowingly exposed to
any more danger than twenty million other inhabitants
of France, went into every action of her waking hours
with a sort of provisional apology. It might be that
she should not have time to finish that action. If so,
would some one please see to it.</p>

<p>She had forgotten completely that other woman.
She remembered only the dear and perfect love of those
months alone with Jimmie; the joy of the irresponsible
hours upon the road; the fearful sweetness of their
utter seclusion in the hills and their complete dependence
one upon the other. She seemed to see now that
they had, in those months, realized all the very best
that this world gives in love.</p>

<p>She had even come to think that she was glad that
their perfect days of love had ended in a sharp crash.
How pitiful it would have been to have seen that love,
which was all beauty and tenderness and sacrifice on
both sides, dribble down into the commonplace of
discontent, or, at best, a kindly tolerance! She was
glad that it had come to an end while it was yet a
perfect, beautiful thing; glad that she could link those
months of wonder love directly with the wonder and
mystery of what was to come to them.</p>

<p>The three years of separation had not kept them
apart. It seemed that they had at first been thrown
violently away from each other. But there had been
an immediate rebound, and Augusta knew that they
had ever since been approaching each other in understanding
and spirit. She had worked, and trained, to
prepare herself for this work so dear to her which she
was doing now. And Jimmie had suffered&mdash;here in
France. Augusta's eyes had seen the things which
he must have gone through, things which her heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and her intuitions had before told her concerning him.
But all seemed only to fit them into the design that
was prepared for them. In fact, in the supreme egoism
of love, it had not been difficult to believe that the
whole world's tragedy had been in some measure
arranged to form a setting for their love.</p>

<p>Every subconscious thought of her waking days,
every half formed dream of day or night had of late
been bringing Jimmie to Augusta, until it seemed
that the terrible world about her&mdash;which she was still
obliged to call reality&mdash;could not much longer persist.
The end must be near. For she had felt the coming
of her love so vividly that material, brute things could
not much longer keep it from her.</p>

<p>Jimmie was coming to her! The mistakes, the travail,
the dim misunderstandings of this phase of being which
was called life, would soon be past. Jimmie and she
would once more take the open road out into the country
of God.</p>

<p>For weeks her spirit had lived upon and breathed
upon her dream, until it, the dream, had become to
her the real. And it seemed to her that she was already
going through the transition that would bring her out
with Jimmie upon the glorious, untried road that lay
beyond the world's death. She had no fear. The very
daring of her dream had raised in her a faith in love
that trembled at nothing.</p>

<p>And then, in an instant, everything had gone black.</p>

<p>She had seen Jimmie. And she had thought that
she saw Jimmie die, and&mdash;and&mdash;<i>nothing</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>Jimmie was gone from her forever. And there was
left to her nothing but the dry little reflection that
she had been a fool.</p>

<p>In those two black days when her soul strained,
listening and watching over the edges of the normal
world, she had breasted the dark tide of despair running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
full down upon her, and not even she herself could
have told how near she was to going down under it.</p>

<p>And in the darkness, as would happen, the old love
came back to mock her. Oh, why, <i>why</i>? had she not
kept the love that was hers? Why had she not fought
that dark woman for it? She had meanly run away,
because it was not good enough, because it was not
perfect. Because she had found a flaw in it she had
thrown away her jewel.</p>

<p>Now it was given her, for punishment, to know
how good that love had been. The touch of Jimmie's
clumsy hands as he had tucked her into her hammock
at night burned her now with the maddening sweetness
of a lost dream. The nights when she had watched over
him, the pride and the swelling love of seeing rugged
health come back to him, the memories of brave,
struggling, laughing walks by his side through wind
and snow, all these and a thousand dear, intimate
memories came to haunt her with the mocking difference
between a warm, happy human love, and the
empty dream that she had made for herself.</p>

<p>But she did not go down under despair.</p>

<p>Jimmie was gone. She would never be near him again.
She did not say it. But she had no strength to deny it.
She was dumb. She was defeated. There was nothing to
live for, and, apparently, nothing to die for.</p>

<p>But her heart held on, beaten, unhoping, but living.</p>

<p>And today, not an hour ago, a wonderful thing had
happened. A miracle had stolen upon her unawares.
She could not now say just where she was or what she
was doing at the time. She had heard nothing, seen
nothing. But she found that she was suddenly, and
unaccountably, certain that Jimmie was not dead.</p>

<p>She did not try to think what might have brought
this intelligence to her. Perhaps he had come back to
consciousness and his heart had answered her. She did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
not care. She did not want to think. Her dream had
sprung back to life again and was once more carrying
her, happy but still trembling and fearful, up again
through the heights from which she had fallen.</p>

<p>She had told the doctor the exact truth. It was not
anything that she had seen or heard. But she <i>knew</i> that
somehow a message had come to her heart from Jimmie.
God had not mocked her faith. She <i>knew</i>. And she
waited.</p>

<p>It was a long, long summer afternoon through which
she worked and waited, her spirit quivering to the
sense of a great wonder hovering near at hand. She did
not feel or recognize any premonition that Wardwell
was physically near her. She had schooled herself well
since those terrible early days, back in the base hospital,
when she had fearfully crept near to and studied every
long bundle of a broken man that was brought in,
praying that it might be, and that it might not be,
Jimmie. She did not do those things now, for she had
learned the heavy cost of them upon her strength and
her nerves. And now, too, she was still living upon
that sight of Jimmie lying out in the open at the foot of a
bank, and, curiously, she did not think of him as having
been moved from there.</p>

<p>When Wardwell awoke again it was because his
throat was hurting abominably. His mind seemed to
clear instantly, and he could not remember to have
felt so wide awake in a long time. He supposed that this
meant that he was going to get well again. He was not
pleased with the prospect, for the weeks of monotonous
endurance just ahead were too well known to be welcome;
but he guessed that he would have to go through
with it. This confounded pain in his throat was about
the worst thing he had ever experienced. His mouth was
all hard and cracked inside and the big bandage above
his shoulders seemed to be set on purpose to choke him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
He would like to put up his hand and see if he couldn't
ease it a little, but he was sure that as soon as he made a
move someone would notice him, and they would
begin the business of poking at him. He would rather
stand this as long as he could if only he were left to
himself.</p>

<p>It was night now&mdash;he knew the shaded lights, the
enforced quiet, the restless murmurings of men asleep
and half asleep, the feeling of a hospital ward at night,
as well as he knew the sound of his own breathing&mdash;and
he had been moved since that last time when he
had been awake. Maybe they had been obliged to clear
him out of the receiving ward&mdash;probably that was where
he had been that last time&mdash;without operating on him.
Maybe the boys were coming down from the stations
pretty fast. He had seen hospitals when the surgeons
couldn't begin to keep up with the work as the men
were brought in. In fact he had seen everything. He
had seen the whole blasted wreck of war from beginning
to end, and he didn't want to see any more of it.</p>

<p>His head was propped a little, so that he could just
see over the roll of bandage on his neck. A wardmaster
was coming softly down the lane between the two rows
of cots. "I know his kind," Wardwell muttered mentally,
while he shut his eyes and waited, perfectly
quiet, for the wardmaster to pass, "their idea of a
good time is to pop a fellow out of a sound sleep right
bang onto an operating table."</p>

<p>He felt rather than heard the wardmaster stop an
instant at the foot of the cot, looking down at him, then
he heard the footfall go softly on down the lane. "Fooled
you that time, old scout," thought Wardwell, with a
sort of a foolish gladness and a feeling that he was just
about to either laugh or cry. His throat did hurt like
fury.</p>

<p>Then he thought of Augusta. Curious, but he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
been certain that she was somewhere near that last
time when he had been awake. Now he did not seem to
be able to feel her near. But just then his mind played a
trick upon him. He did not know whether or not he had
shut his eyes for the moment, but he saw something
that he very distinctly remembered having seen before.
One feverish night, in the wagon, on the road, four
years ago, he had wakened from an early sleep. A bar of
white moonlight came in through a little square opening
above the flap of the wagon and fell directly on the
pale golden crown of Augusta's rippling hair. She was
kneeling on the bare floor of the wagon, her arms and
head sagged forward into her little hammock.</p>

<p>She had fallen asleep at her night prayers.</p>

<p>And he felt now the big choking throb of pity and
tenderness and love that had come up in his throat at
the sight of her. The memory dropped away instantly,
and he was again staring through the dimmed lights at
the bare board walls of the long ward room. But it did
not seem that Augusta was quite so far away as she
had been when he awoke.</p>

<p>It is of no connection here. But Augusta was, at that
moment, across the open court in the nurses' pavilion,
in the dark by the side of her own cot, happily saying
her tired night prayers.</p>

<p>Wardwell lay quiet a little while, wondering how long
he would be able to hold out against the burning pain
in his throat. Perhaps he was foolish after all. Maybe
he might as well call attention to himself and let them
have it over with. They wouldn't hurt him any more
than this.</p>

<p>There was a queer thumping noise coming from
somewhere, which he could not make out, and which
annoyed him. It was not gunfire of any kind&mdash;didn't
he know every kind?&mdash;and if it were, what would it be
doing around here? He must be miles and miles down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
from any fighting line. This was a regular, big, established
hospital. He had no idea as to just where it was,
but it was certainty a long way from where fighting was
to be done. Yet there were explosions going on somewhere
around here. He had no personal interest in the
matter, but he wanted to know what the deuce they
were thinking of. Didn't they know that there were
wounded men here who ought to have quiet!</p>

<p>But the thumping kept on, and came closer.</p>

<p>Now there were other sounds, voices outside. Other
people had noticed the thing, and they were going to
have it stopped. Well, it certainly ought to be stopped.
Wardwell saw that some of the fellows around him were
being waked up by it, and he felt sorry and indignant
for them. It was a shame! Some confounded <span class="locked">fool&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The heavy thud and shudder of an explosion shook
the light walls of the ward, and on its heels there followed
a roaring, tearing, ripping sound of timbers and
boards being torn apart and flung about through the
air. Then there rose the cries of men and women,
running together and shouting in the night. Then you
could hear sharp orders snapped out of the confusion.</p>

<p>Another and more terrifying explosion blew out the
end of a building just a little way from the ward where
Wardwell lay, and a flying timber, driven endwise,
jabbed through the roof and stuck six feet of its length
into the ward, right over a fellow's head, fourth bed
to the left. Wardwell was sure he counted right. He
would like to know who the poor <span class="locked">fellow&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Now there came a continuous rock and roar that
seemed to come right up out of the earth and turn to
smash everything flat, and the popping of aircraft
guns hurried up by cursing men began to announce the
hideous truth of what was happening.</p>

<p>A man whose cot lay foot to foot across from Wardwell's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
sat straight up. He was an oldish man, among the
men here, with a good round face and a bald head.</p>

<p>"God blast them blind!" he said soberly. "They're
bombing the Red Cross right over our heads!"</p>

<p>The wardmaster came walking up the line between
the beds, speaking steadily through the roaring,
splintering din.</p>

<p>"Silence, boys," he was saying, "and keep the
blankets up over you. It's all we can do. They're passing
over now. It can't last long."</p>

<p>Now Wardwell considered this thing, and his hands
went slowly and craftily up to the bandages around his
neck. He was fairly certain that if he loosened the
bandages he would bleed and faint and die in a very
short time. God! A man had <i>some</i> rights in this business!</p>

<p>He had stood out and lain out to be shot at from every
angle with every kind of a gun that had been made.
And he had not even complained at the gas. But to be
butchered now, when he was lying here with a pain in
his throat that would have made him cry if even the
gentlest nurse's hand touched him! He would not have
it! A man had <i>some</i> rights!</p>

<p>His hands found the bandages and began to tug at
them, but a frightful crash up at the end of the ward,
where the wardmaster had just walked, held his attention
for a moment.</p>

<p>In the tail light of the explosion he saw boards, and
men, and a medicine chest, and beds, and the end of the
building, erupting all together out into the night. And
then, when he could look again he saw through the
open space the low horizon stars shining gently in their
places.</p>

<p>The lights were gone now, and he could feel the
fright rising in the men around him. They were afraid
in the dark. They began to yell. Some swore queer
oaths, original ones, with tears in their throats. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
called to God. And some yelled pitifully to somebody
to bring a light.</p>

<p>Wardwell began again to tug at the bandages.</p>

<p>But just then, above the cursing, and some praying,
and the frightful, tearing roar of death all about, he
heard a girl, down near the end of the room that was
still sound, a girl had come into the ward singing. He
listened, and the words that he heard were these:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Gyp, Gyp, me little horse?</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Gyp-Gyp, again, sir.</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>How many miles to Dublin?</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Four score an' ten, sir.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>High and sweet as the voice of a robin bird in the
trees of the Hills of Desire he heard the voice of his
love.</p>

<p>Then the howl and the tearing jaws of death all
around had their sway again. He had thought always
that Augusta would somehow come to him before the
end. But, My God! he had never bargained for this!
This was real! Augusta was here, in this death hole!
He must get her out of here. What business had she!
Who had let her come here?</p>

<p>He was out of his cot and staggering, bumping down
the cot frames, toward the voice that rang again
triumphant, singing:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Gyp, Gyp, me little horse?</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Gyp-Gyp, again, sir.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now he was coming near her. Now! Another staggering
step or two, if he could only keep his feet straight!
Now he was just going to touch her, to take her in his
arms! He had almost lurched past her in the dark. Now
he had her in his arms!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
He thought he whispered her name, but it was really
a wild yell in her ear:</p>

<p>"<i>Augusta!</i>"</p>

<p>In the first swaying, burning instant their hearts
leaped together and were one at last. There was nothing
from the past; nothing to be explained, nothing to be
condoned. Love and truth had burned all things clear
and true for them. They belonged to each other. They
were of each other. And neither life nor death could
touch their love now!</p>

<p>And now, curiously, it was Wardwell who did not
resist what seemed to be the conclusion of fate. He
had not wanted to die with Augusta. He had wanted
to <i>live</i> with her! But now, if she had foreseen this, that
they were to go together in this way: Well, he was
willing to take her lead, as always. She should have
her way. Her way was always right.</p>

<p>But Augusta had her love in her arms, and he was
wounded, and fainting, and leaning upon her. The
fierce, protecting surge of mothering nature rose up
in her. She looked into the face of fire, and red murder,
and death, and sprang into battle with them all for
him. They should not have him! He was hers, and <i>she</i>
would have him!</p>

<p>She had come into her ward singing her little song,
to help the poor fellows through a bad few minutes.
She could not have dreamed that it was to be as bad
as this fiendish reality, but she had already forgotten
her indignation, her pity, her thought of anyone or
anything but Jimmie Wardwell who was swaying leaning
upon her breast. To take him out of here to the
blessed open, to keep him from being hurt, was the
thing, it seemed, for which she had lived her life!</p>

<p>The short moment of darkness in which they had
somehow found each other was blasted out into a
white flaring light and they were shaken stumbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and trembling together by an explosion which completely
blew out the end of the building where Augusta
had come in.</p>

<p>Looking over her shoulder she saw that she must
take him, carry him if he could not help her, out through
that band of fire where already the jagged sides and
roof of the building were being fringed with scallops
of licking flame.</p>

<p>She called on him for an effort, pleading with him
to try, to put one foot before another, to help just one
little bit. But his weight lay almost dead upon her
shoulder. He was fainting from his effort to come to
her and from the shock of the last terrible explosion.
She must do all herself. The hoop of fire flamed before
her, through which she must drag him, and her mind
and reason quailed but her heart fought on for its love,
blessing God for the strong sure feet that the hills had
given her and the cunning strength in handling the
helpless bodies of men which her training had taught
her. These things had been given to her for this her
moment.</p>

<p>Her ears were full of the fearful cries of men in madness,
her eyes were open only to see that ring of fire
toward which she was staggering with her burden,
but her heart was strong and sure. What cared she for
the dreams of a heaven that she had made, when she
had the warm body of her love in her arms!</p>

<p>All the women in creation might write love letters
to him, but he was hers and she would take him through
that ring of fire and out to safety! He was hers, and
she would have him!</p>

<p>Men shouted to her, to go back, that help was coming
quickly another way, that she was crazy to try to go
out that way. But she fought her way out step by step,
through all the blurring horror, up to the ring of fire,
and, staggering, whispering, praying to her love, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
went stumbling through wreck and spitting flames,
half carrying, half dragging her man out into God's
open.</p>

<p>A little way out in the grass, away from the worst
of the danger, she stopped&mdash;she could go no farther&mdash;and
let him slip, cunningly and gently as she could,
full length upon the ground.</p>

<p>For the moment, they were left alone. Men running
shouting to the work of rescue did not heed them.
And Augusta knelt fixing the big bandage to Jimmie's
throat, and whispering to him. For now, when the
strength of her body was exhausted, her heart went
cold with the fear that he had died in her arms.</p>

<p>But the cool freshness of the grass came up like a
reviving shock to Wardwell's body. He stirred easily,
drew two or three good breaths, and then he spoke,
slowly and easily.</p>

<p>"How is it, dear," he asked, plainly knowing that
Augusta was there with him, "are we going <i>on</i>, or do
we stay? Whichever it is, you know, I'm for you."</p>

<p>Augusta gave one little animal cry of pure joy. For,
instantly, she <i>knew</i> that all was well, that she would
have him again, alive and strong! Then she bubbled
over in tears and the hysteria of gladness, crying:</p>

<p>"We're going to <i>stay</i>, Jimmie darling, we're going
to <i>stay</i>! And if I wasn't afraid of hurting you, I'd hug
and kiss you till&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you might take a chance&mdash;" said Jimmie. And
he went contentedly off to sleep.</p>

<p>Out of the chaos of noise and the uncertain light a
big tall doctor man came striding across the grass to
them, dressed in a long white operating coat which he
had forgotten to throw off.</p>

<p>Augusta rose to her knees and to her overstrained
senses the tall white figure advancing upon her must
have taken on some kind of a supernatural appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
We do not know just what was in her mind, probably
it is not important. But she raised her hand in a foolish
little salute, and said, somewhat apologetically, to the
doctor:</p>

<p>"If you please, God, we've changed our mind. We'd
much rather live."</p>

<p>Then she slid quietly down in a faint beside Jimmie.</p>

<p>To this day that surgeon thinks that he did not
hear correctly.</p>
